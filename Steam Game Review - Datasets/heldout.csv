DrShocktopus,36.0,"August 19, 2024",8190,"Beat the first boss which is the one in the trailer, the white wolf.And I have to say, so far really enjoying the game.It's basically a Chinese God of War (2018) and the Jedi Fallen series, and like those games it has some soulsborne influences, but doesn't lean too heavily into it. If you enjoyed God of War (2018) and the Jedi Fallen Order/Survivor, then you will definitely enjoy this, personally find this to be a bit more fun.",True,
MiAh The King,1.5,"August 19, 2024",7552,"Yes I'm aware that my thumbs up is never going to be seen by anyone. There is literally thousands of them. But what I'm NOT seeing is people actually talking about the game. At least at time of writing. Most people are talking about how good it looks, or how well it plays. Or vice versa. But no one talking about what the game is like. Or how it feels to play it. Is it worth my fricken money???Well let me help with that. Yes it's worth the money.It's a souls-like game despite it not having that tag on the steam store page. It plays similar to Jedi Fallen Order or God of War or Darksiders. It's a linear action game where if you die you go back to a resting point. If you rest at said resting point all enemies respawn as does your healing items. However unlike Dark Souls or Elden Ring you don't lose experience points, money or items when you die.But yes, the production value in this game is off the charts. It looks even more beautiful then it does on the steam store page. It sounds beautiful too. The gameplay is also fun, fluid and engaging. There's so much done right about this game that I hate to talk about whats wrong with it.For instance the tutorial is severely lacking. Barely teaches you anything. Or how there's little to no direction in the game. Unless i'm severely missing something. But After the first hour I was absolutely, completely. 100 percent lost. No idea where to go or what to do. The game is lacking in direction in pretty much every single definition of the word and I actually hate that.But if you can find your own way, don't mind really hard games and don't mind a character with no character or a plot with no plot then this game does everything else 110 percent perfect.So let that be your deciding factor I guess. I mean 60 dollars is still a lot of money, just know what you're getting into. But if this genre is what you're looking for then it's worth the money.If you'd like a more in-depth look at the game and what not feel free to check out my review on my YouTube Channel (link below).Otherwise, thanks so much for reading and I hope I managed to help some of you out there spend your money wisely.",True,
TLandry,25.0,"August 19, 2024",5142,"Visually stunning. Despite saying better on a controller, I actually like the gameplay on my mouse and keyboard. I'm not usually into this type of genre often but I am very much enjoying the story and especially the visuals. PURE EYE CANDY. Running on a 4080 Super @ 3440x1440 I'm getting a steady 60-80 fps with graphics set to 'cinematic', the highest it goes with RT set to High. No crashing or issues seen yet detected and game is running smoooth as butter.",True,
惊喜,37.6,"August 24, 2024",3827,"it is a pretty nice game, very good boss fights, excellent CGs with outstanding art. I'll give a 8.5 out of 10. We need bugs repairing and game playing optimization in future updates.",True,

Gantz,113.7,"August 20, 2024",3344,"Honestly I kept my expectations low because it seemed too good to be true especially being the first game from the studio but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ they nailed it.

Faewolf,55.3,"September 5, 2024",2968,"Remember when a game was just a game? Apparently these devs do. This game is a single, complete, no nonsense game. No DLC bundles. No microtransactions, no battle passes, no live services, and no BS. Just a single game with a solid amount of content, (mostly) fair difficulty challenges, a good amount of secrets to unlock, a serviceable story, and fun gameplay.

Pascal,44.2,"September 1, 2024",2263,"Might be the first time where negative reviews actually made me buy a game.Great—Not every game needs to have an open, fully explorable world. I'd much rather have a linear experience in beautifully crafted environments, which this game has. Honestly, there's much exploring to do, and it's always worthwhile.I would never have expected this to be an actual complaint. This game gives me flashbacks to the late '90s and early 2000s, where you actually play a game and don't get directions spoon-fed. You have to use your eyes and recognize where you've been and where you can still go. It's what makes exploration fun and worthwhile. Backtracking through areas to see if you missed anything.Again—How is this a negative? The boss fights are the reason we play this genre of games. I'm amazed at how much love and attention has been put into each boss. They all have gorgeous visuals and fun, engaging movesets.I find diversity, equality, and inclusion important topics. However, not every game needs it. Some games have a good place and fit for it, like Baldur's Gate 3, which does it very well. However, this is a mythological game where you play as a monkey and beat up rats, lizards, and the like.This is one of the few games in the last few years where I'm having a blast playing. It feels like a mix between God of War and Monster Hunter in a Souls-like sauce. The game is hard enough to be challenging but easy enough to craft your own build without googling for strong and effective builds.",True,
[Msc*]EngDesignEnjoyer,46.5,"August 19, 2024",1679,"I'm sure the Western gaming press didn't give ‘Black Myth: Wukong’ the rating it deserved.It's not because I'm a Chinese gamer that I blindly praise my country for creating a work of art.From the IGN review: ‘The story assumes you have knowledge of Journey to the West and is tough to follow without it’. I think localised translations do present some problems, as many complex cultural backgrounds take a long time to research in order to make the most accurate translation.But for all the overseas players, please trust me that a lot of the game's backstory is hard to understand even for me, such as some of the words carved on the stone monuments.In addition, there is also something that game science, a game maker, likes to hide content, and many parts of the game content are scattered throughout the game, requiring players to constantly explore and dig into the details.For a Chinese gamer like me, I finally don't have to go to the language settings to find the language option and change it to Simplified Chinese. Now I just need to keep the default settings.I hope this game can become a huge success and everyong can enjoy the game content while he is exploring the mysterious world of Journey to the West.If you encounter some obscure content while playing, you can leave a comment. I will go to the Chinese search engine to see if I can find the answer (I am not sure I can solve your problem), but everyone can express their own opinions. I believe this is the joy of playing games together and understanding them.",True,
ChewbaccaJones,47.3,"August 23, 2024",1352,"There is exactly zero chance this is the review that makes you buy this game considering there are a quarter-million similar endorsements, but: This game definitely goes on the top games of all time list...right near the top alongside Witcher Wild Hunt, BG3. and Ghost of Tsushima.  It isn't ""perfect in every way""; but what it does well, it does better than most before it and resets several bars in terms of expectations for games going forward.  Its graphics, its fluidity in movement; its animations; its level design; its bosses...all top-notch.  It is absolutely NOT a souls-like.  It has a few elements of what makes soulslikes great; but leaves out the frustrating parts. It acknowledges that it is already a tough game and doesn't further burden the player with the tedious punishments that some of us souls-like-fatigued have become accustomed to tolerating:- No hunting down souls dropped- No min/maxing builds based on a subset of weapon types- fewer punishing second-phase fightsMay seem like a short list, but the lack of that ""Holy crap, I hate this game...I can't believe I just grinded through this entire level for the past hour only to get one-shotted and lost all my progress"" feeling.As many other players have noted, this game is far closer to GOW.  My favorite description I read so far was: ""It's like God Of War, Ghost of Tsushima, and Elden Ring had a threesome and nobody knows who the father is.""Cons (short list):- invisible walls are especially noticeable in the first chapter.  Annoying to see something that looks like a cave, but hit an invisible wall five feet in front of it.- A noticeable halo effect caused by what appears to be post-processing setting. Toning that down made a good improvement.- some heavy granular effects by what I assume is some graphics setting in either post-processing.- Not sure if the ""FSR"" is FSR3...also, we can't completely turn off the FSR/DLSS apparently...it looks like we can only set it to quality and up the resolution limit to 100%.  It would be nice to be able to turn it off; even if it is only for a comparison.  But aside from those very minor nitpicks, this game is an all-time-top-tier-absolutely fabulous game and I HOPE MAJOR GAME STUDIOS WILL SEE HOW SUCCESSFUL THIS IS AND FOLLOW THEIR LEAD!!!More of this type of game: Complete; functional on launch; great writing; great characters; outstanding graphics and gameplay...NO MICROTRANSACTIONS...Buy it. It is worth it and then some.",True,

Ted,102.6,"August 22, 2024",1027,"The game devs have said many times this is not a souls-like, I corrected people many times to tell them it is not a souls-like. Turns out that yeah, I think it is very much a souls-like. Right off I think this is going to create a problem for a lot of buyers who likely were expecting an ""action RPG"" as while it certainly does have some of those characteristics, make no mistake, this is a very difficult game at times. The combat is definitely souls inspired though it is quite unique in some ways, as there is effectively no base blocking mechanic but rather you basically build up energy to unleash heavier attacks and you can do so via dodging perfectly or many basic hits on an enemy (to put it simply). At first as a souls enjoyer I struggled to understand what they were expecting and the combat initially felt clumsy and not at all tight. But once you lock in and start learning how to perfectly dodge, there is nothing more satisfying than pulling off multiple perfect dodges back to back, with a very satisfying audio and visual effect to indicate you did pull off a perfect dodge. But it took me hours of dying to the first 'boss' (Wandering Wight) to finally realise the combat is fast, punishing but immensely satisfying and I think that is being overlooked with all the drama surrounding the game. That being said, I would have loved a ranged option to deal with the very annoying archers that appear regularly and for a monkey man, he seems to have a distinct lack of climbing ability which seems a bit oddOn that note, we all probably know the premise of the story and it is presented beautifully, if slightly confusing if you are unfamiliar with the source material. The Chinese mythological setting of the game is not something I have played in often if at all, so it makes for an interesting and original setting for me and the fact it is absolutely beautiful and atmospheric is just icing on the cake here. They have created some full AAA quality cutscenes to move along telling the story and they feel not unlike the grand cutscenes in God of War in scope and quality, they really have done a great job here in my opinion. The world is absolutely beautiful with a very distinct Unreal 5 look to it, though it is very linear with some limited exploration to be had but you will often find an invisible wall stopping you from venturing off the trail and they maybe could have been a bit more creative with how they keep you in the limits of the map without just straight up invisible walls but for me this is just a minor complaint. Sound is great and of course the graphics are stunning, though of course with the caveat that this is an Unreal 5 game and it uses all the latest visual fluff, so don't think you're going to max this out on your GTX 1050 and have good time. But it scales well and if you follow guides like the Hardware Unboxed optimisation guide you should be able to get it running well on very modest hardware. In summary I think this is one game that surprisingly lived up to the hype, while it isn't perfect I think overall these guys have done an amazing job for their first big release and it could very well end up being one of the top games of this year. I think a big thing to understand as a potential buyer going into this game, is that it is VERY difficult at times and this I am sure is going to catch a lot of people out as an unpleasant surprise.",True,
Bearsonal,37.2,"August 23, 2024",1018,"Black Myth: Wukong was a game I’d been eagerly waiting for since it was first revealed in 2020. Like many others, I was skeptical about whether the developers could deliver on such an ambitious project. I don’t think the Steam reviews and player counts accurately reflect the reality. The overwhelmingly positive reviews and high player counts are largely driven by nationalistic support from China, where the game is celebrated as a major achievement. While my review is positive because I do believe the game is good, I also think it is kind of overrated. As always, I aim to provide honest opinions and a truthful assessment of my experience. I am writing this review after actually completing this game, unlike every review with 2 hours and claiming it GOTY.The game’s graphics are outstanding. The visual fidelity, from the breathtaking environments to the intricate character designs, is top-notch. The animations, visual effects, and render distance are all impressive, adding to the game’s overall looks. The sound effects are equally well done, though the soundtrack leaves much to be desired. While the game runs smoothly for the most part, Chapter 3, particularly the snowy maps, does suffer from performance issues. Despite this, the overall optimization is solid, and the game manages to maintain its high graphical standards without too many hiccups.The bosses in Black Myth: Wukong are a real feat to play against. When it was revealed that the game had 81 bosses, I was sure that at least half of them would be replicated, similar to what we saw in Elden Ring. But it's shocking and great to say that more than 90% of the bosses in the game are unique, each one fun to play and mostly well-designed. However, most of the bosses are surprisingly easy. Speaking of difficulty, I’ve seen some people argue that Wukong isn’t a Soulslike, but I would definitely consider it one. It has everything a Souls game offers, except for the corpse-run mechanic. It has some similarities to God of War and Bayonetta, but I believe it’s much closer to Soulsborne titles than that.The game feels and combat is initially great and fun to play. The fluidity of movement and the responsiveness of controls are great. However, as I played through the game, I found that it became too repetitive for me, even with the large variety of bosses and enemy types. Once you discover which combos and moves work best, there’s little need to change them. The same goes for the Spirit mechanics. The game provides you with a ton of spirits, but once you find a good one and upgrade it, there’s really no need to use others, just like how most people only played with the Mimic Tear in Elden Ring. The spells, while fun to use, also feel limited in variety. Only having four spells for a 40-hour game made the experience feel stale over time. Additionally, the spells cost mana, which restricts their usage, especially during boss fights. Since the most fun aspect of Wukong is using these spells, this limitation is quite a shame.The big skill trees in the game primarily change your passive stats and your heavy attack, which you use rarely. This adds to the repetitiveness of the combat since the skill trees don’t significantly alter how you engage in battles, making the combat feel even more repetitive as you progress.When it comes to the story, Black Myth: Wukong seemingly tells the story of Journey to the West. I have no prior knowledge of this story or the movie, so I didn’t get much out of it. The mute protagonist doesn’t help either. The game seems to expect players to be familiar with the original story, which made it hard for me to connect with the narrative.The level and map design is by far the worst part of Black Myth: Wukong and the major thing that severely impacted my experience, reducing the enjoyment I got from the game by miles. In Chapter 1, the level design is very linear—you kill a few enemies, 30 seconds later comes an amazing boss fight, you kill another bunch, and a minute later, another spectacular boss fight. This pattern repeats until the end of the chapter. At first, I wasn't sure if I liked this; it felt odd and almost made the game seem like a boss rush experience. But since I was enjoying the heck out of the bosses, I loved this design choice, and fighting new bosses every 10 minutes was such a joy. This continued the same way until I reached the Tiger Vanguard boss fight, which is the peak of Black Myth Wukong in terms of game design tempo. The boss was one of the best in the game. At that point, I was sure I was playing the Game of the Year 2024 and possibly one of the best action games I've ever played.Unfortunately, that's when the game began going downhill. By Chapter 3, the game started to feel very repetitive, with the same combat mechanics being reused over and over. In Chapters 2 and 3, you start playing in huge, open world-ish maps. Now, is that a bad thing? Elden Ring did the same, right? No, because Wukong's maps are filled with limiting invisible walls everywhere. There are hundreds of the same enemies throughout the map, and you often go in a direction unsure if it's worth your time. You never know if you’ll find a new boss, an invisible wall, a little XP, or just nothing at all. I found myself sprinting around the huge maps only to find nothing most of the time, as there was no indicator if the journey was worth it. What adds to the frustration is that the game doesn’t guide you to your main objective, or even clearly define what it is. So, if you’re bored of aimlessly wandering around, you can't simply rush to the main quest. This lack of direction makes the game feel even more disjointed and tiresome. The issue peaks in Chapter 6, where the game becomes a frustrating slog. There’s never an indoor-level design to alleviate this, except for one extremely linear and frustrating dungeon. The lack of a map or compass is a particularly bad decision, especially since even FromSoftware addressed this with Elden Ring. The graphical quality of the maps is insane, but they look extremely bland and uninspiring compared to the art design of Elden Ring. This detracts from the game’s atmosphere and overall enjoyment.The music and soundtrack are also quite poor, which significantly affects the atmosphere of the world. The only song I liked was the one sung by the headless dude; nothing else stood out. No Soulsborne or Soulslike game has ever come close to the level of Dark Souls 3's soundtrack, and Wukong doesn’t change that.Many bosses and enemies have a tendency to freeze during fights, some even becoming invincible. These bugs made me replay the same enemies several times.In conclusion, Black Myth: Wukong is a good game, even though it’s far from meeting all of my expectations. Despite its shortcomings, it is a very solid entry from Game Science. I will be highly looking forward to their next game as much as I did for Black Myth: Wukong, hoping they will improve upon these shortcomings and deliver an even more polished experience. I don’t have a definitive Game of the Year candidate for this year, but I can confidently say that Black Myth: Wukong isn't it. For me, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown stands out as a better title.Follow My",True,
FroheMilchmann,35.8,"August 22, 2024",920,"(Review in progress, 8h so far, 2 chapters completed)This game surprised me more than I expected. The level of polish and care put into it is quite impressive and I absolutely loved my time with it so far. Graphics and art-design are top notch, sound design is great, music has its highs and lows, but what it doesn't lack is identity, it's pretty original. If you're familiar with the original story or Chinese mythology, you'll probably love the interpretations of characters from there, if you have no idea what is it about, prepare yourself for a wild ride, it can get quite weird, but equally amazing. Now, the main thing - gameplay. Overall I can say that it's pretty fun and I had a good time with it, especially thanks to the very decent enemy variety and non-stop bosses with their own quirks, but the only gripe that I personally have with the game - is the lack of combos, or just overall depth of core staff combat. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, however it seems like the combat's variety is leaning more towards a couple of special abilities and you waiting for them to be available again, while with the staff itself you have only one light attack combo and with that only 3 variations of heavy attacks, plus you can't cancel out of many of your animations, which is annoying in a game like this. Also most of your character progression is tied to stats improvements. I guess after playing many games like DMC series, Bayonettas, even something like recent GOW, Darksiders etc, I got spoiled with even more responsive and flexible combat systems, but other than that, I'm more than satisfied with everything else.Can I recommend it? Heck yeah! We need more single-player games like this one.Who is it for? I'd say it's a mix of a Souls-like meets GOW, but it has its own unique ideas as well.Final score (as of now) - 8.5/10 If the game manages to surprise me with something else, I'll be glad to raise the score to at least 9/10, but I'm a bit picky about some gameplay details. Still impressed though.UPD after 30 hours and almost finishing the game - I'll leave the score at 8.5 and my main points still stand. This game is impressive and it's one of the best and most solid 8/8.5 out of 10 sorta games you'll ever play, but some parts of the game outstay their welcome and combat doesn't evolve much (some people have a different opinion on this, and that's fine by me). Other than that, I loved it.",True,

Marina,42.6,"August 23, 2024",885,"So far I love everything about this game. From the story, visuals, gameplay... it's a beautiful game about chinese mythology and a rare gem of 2024. The world and visuals are stunning, although exploration is linear I want to see everything this game has to offer. This is also the first game where I chose not to play in default english, as it sounds so much better in original voice (chinese) and it makes for a more unique experience.Combat is souls inspired, but difficulty is very forgiving. There is no block/parry button, you only have to dodge attacks at the right time. Also at dying you won't loose anything, but enemies will respawn on dying and resting. This game is not hard as souls-like so noob casuals like me can give this a try. However it can still be challenging and some bosses will make you die over and over again. You can't rush in and mash buttons expecting not to die in a few hits. With that said you may have to adapt your skill points, thankfully respec doesn't cost anything so you have all the freedom to try out different abilities/playstyle.To summarize, it's an amazing singleplayer game with all the right components- interesting story, great gameplay, amazing visuals and sound effects. Optimization is very good. I can play it on my old pc (i5-7500 and GTX 1060) with a bit of tweaking. Great purchase, fantastic game! 10/10",True,
Iugracten,58.4,"August 19, 2024",881,"Amazing game in every aspect. Totally recommended it if you're into something similar to God of War (the new one) with some soulslike mechanics. Very fun to play, linear and semi-open world regions with lots of exploration, secrets, enemies and some remarkable bosses.As far as performance goes, if you don't use Ray Tracing on Very High (or don't use it at all) and turn on upscaling, you'll be fine. Ray Tracing is quite demanding in some areas later in the game. Even with Frame Generation, it may not be enough depending on your GPU. Also, yes, New Game+ unlocks after you finish the game.

Nirhildija,5.9,"August 20, 2024",622,"I played 9 hours but 4 were offline so I think it will say I played 5 hours, I didn't beat the game, yet I still made this comprehensive review to explain the core aspects of the game and it's quality. This review uses my own experience and those of my friends who got ahead in the game. I am 30 years old, and I don't enjoy souls likes anymore in the long term. Still, I did my review objectively and I think you might find it useful. Cheers!~Black Myth Wukong is a soul-like game that adds some interesting elements to the genre by incorporating new ideas into its gameplay through the legendary tale of Sun Wukong. Players can transform into bosses they defeated before (with some limitations), and Wukong's tricks are plenty. They can range from transforming into rock to making multiple clones of themselves or freezing foes in place, unable to move or fight back.The player will explore the tale of the legendary monkey king while fighting challenging bosses and recovering the artifacts of Wukong. The game starts easy but rapidly reaches difficulty levels of your most popular soul games, requiring skill, strategy, and wits to defeat fearsome foes. If there is something people hear about this game, it is two things: transforming into bosses and ray tracing. The ray tracing of the game looks beautiful, as reflections and environments look superb on the screen. The requirements are quite bulky, as I used an RTX 4070 Super and could either go 2k with Ray Tracing at medium with settings on very high for 70-90 FPS or 4k with no ray tracing at the same frame rate.The story is surprisingly very good and interesting, voice actors do well in their assigned roles, and the opening of the game is similar to a blockbuster movie. The tale deals with wanting to be free, which Wukong wants, but the Celestial Court won't let him be. In addition, the court enjoys mocking him and other beast-like creatures, angering him as he rebels to prove his might. The difficulty is another aspect that might attract players looking to establish themselves and face off against challenging foes in exciting and nerve-wracking gameplay.The game's core combat focuses on options and the availability of resources. The player has multiple avenues for choosing how to fight enemies, such as spirits that they can summon and take their form to unleash special attacks, becoming bosses, using skills such as invisibility, or using their pole to get above the enemy and avoid attacks. Having so many assets to use on foes and see what works best against certain enemies is incredibly fun and rewarding.The premise is that the game is a boss rush; you go to a place, explore it, beat the boss, and move on. If you defeat bosses effortlessly, you run into a lot of bosses on the norm, and each combat is intriguing and unique. Battle monks that summon the fallen, rat siblings in a 1vs2, giant tigers that bathe in the blood of their foes with big swords, etc. The game action is fast, so you have to act quickly before enemies resume the onslaught of attacks. There is no co-op for this game (so those that like souls games with co-op experiences, be warned, it is only going to be you!), and there is no punishment for dying in-game, so you are stress-free and don't have to pick up your ""souls"" or currencies of other types.I enjoyed my time in the game, as brief as it was (I am getting old to be playing this hardcore game, I swear, haha~). I didn't find the stances attractive, as the default stance worked better for me than the other two. The tricks of Wukong are fun to use, and in boss fights, you need to use all of your arsenals intelligently to emerge victorious on the challenging boss fights, which is a great gameplay design. Enemies often have their particular bag of tricks they will use on the player.I used many points in the foundation, mainly HP and stamina. I also used some points in transformations and the immobility spell, as they are instrumental. The gameplay is like a combination of souls, like in action games. It is hard, but you are as powerful as your foes, making the soul-like experience less stressful and difficult. The game's presentation is fantastic; enemies react to your boss's transformations, and the dialogue in fights is on par with the rest of the game. A game playthrough will last between 40-60 hours, depending on your skill, and you can always replay the game after beating it to challenge even stronger foes. I am getting burned out of the genre. Go there, fight a powerful enemy, get destroyed, do it again until you succeed, and repeat for another 40 hours. I may have been playing too much Elden Ring, but I don't enjoy Souls games as much as I did before.Back to the review, if you like challenges meant to block your progression and prove your skills, this game is impressive. It excels at all its facets and is incredible to experience. If you prefer to avoid difficulty, be wary. It is a marathon to get to the end of this title, as the mountain is rather tall and complex to climb.It is an easy buy for its asking price. If your computer can run it, you are guaranteed to have a good time with this game.In a genre so cluttered with so many games that it feels oversaturated, Black Myth Wukong succeeds in adding a new spice to the genre by revolutionizing the gameplay and rewards of its core experience. It is a must-play for all souls, like fans who enjoy this title, and an invitation to try it out for those who feel braver and confident in their skills. This game's graphics, music, story, gameplay, and design are superb and worth all the praise it's been getting.10/10 MASTERPIECE:) If you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator!",True,
ANDYROXUS,56.1,"August 24, 2024",617,"This is what peak gaming looks like ladies and gentlemen... Remember, Reject humanity, embrace Monke!!",True,
Heath,45.3,"September 9, 2024",605,"For the last couple of weeks, I've been brushing up on my Journey to the West knowledge, not least because of its obvious surge in relevance, but also its status as one of the most influential written works of all time, its presence inescapable across a whole host of modern media. From its episodic, monster-of-the-week structure to the rambunctious and hilariously overpowered Sun Wukong, it might as well be the original shonen anime and, the more I read, the more impossible its massive reach becomes to ignore.Game Science's take on the classic novel is not the typical homage or adaptation, but rather something of a follow-up, opening with the Monkey King, wholly disinterested in the Buddhahood awarded to him at the end of the titular journey, clashing in the clouds with the forces of Heaven, themselves quite unable to trust the innocence in the chronically mischievous Wukong's return to a simple, earthly life. Overwhelmed and stricken down, you pick up some five hundred years later as the Destined One, an auspicious monkey tasked with retrieving the scattered relics of the defeated Great Sage, their unification capable of returning him once more to the land of the living.It's something of a retelling, too, with each of the six largely stand-alone chapters transporting the Destined One to destinations from the original journey, complete with their assorted villains and supporting casts. It's an approach those intimately familiar with the source material will no doubt appreciate; however, it's a narrative heavily reliant on pre-existing knowledge of those destinations, villains and supporting casts and, in tandem with a frustrating aversion to almost all forms of exposition, subtle or otherwise, I seriously struggle to see those new to Chinese myth following anything but the broadest strokes.Myself included, to an extent (the version of the book I'm familiar with isn't a complete translation), yet the less I understood, the more I realised how little it ultimately mattered. Each chapter concludes with an unbelievably gorgeous and expertly scored five or so-minute animation rendered in an entirely different style and format than the last, and while I won't hesitate to admit a fair amount of the little details and references soared cleanly over my head, the passion, care and unwavering reverence for the source material is utterly unmistakeable. Coupled with meticulous, striking enemy design and truly breathtaking scenery, there's a profound artistry in every corner of Black Myth's composition, so much more than just a plot to get wrapped up in, and any concerns of missing context quickly fall by the wayside.These days, it's hard to find a single third-person action game that doesn't in some way fall victim to the soulslike allegations, and Black Myth is no exception, the bulk of critics veritably frothing at the mouth at the slightest possibility something might be treading even a fraction of Miyazaki's illustrious path. However, with a stark emphasis on combo building, active abilities and a gargantuan skill tree, the Destined One's moveset strikes me as much more Nioh (another soulslike, I know, despite its combat being anything but) than anything else, with much of the feel of modern God of War and all the style of character action.It's a lot more empowering than the typical Souls model, too: among the smattering of spells you'll eventually get your monkey paws on, one of the early ones is functionally little more than a simple evade and counter, but the dramatic swoosh of the initial dodge, the blinding speed of the re-engage, and the punchy slow-mo of the following punish result in a move far more thrilling than any basic description might suggest. The rest of the kit is similarly flamboyant; you're generally stuck with just the Monkey King's classic staff throughout, but you've got a few different stances switching up its heavy attack, each making full and bombastic use of the weapon's iconic shape-shifting capabilities.Alongside an almost gratuitously twirly light attack combo culminating in a powerful overhead slam, rounding out the Destined One's combat prowess are the yaoguai transfigurations: one an equipable spirit allowing you to take the form of a fallen foe just long enough to bust out their signature move, the other a considerably more rare, complete transformation, equipped with a full moveset, a separate health bar, and lasting a fair bit longer than the spiritual counterpart.All told, you're left with a fast, meaty, and strategic combat model defined by a vast arsenal of abilities, all capable of turning the tide of battle in an instant and tested in a tremendous variety of boss encounters. While a few too many of these epic clashes have a bad habit of prioritising spectacle over clarity, these battles are otherwise brilliantly designed, creatively rich, and the centrepiece of the Black Myth experience, an almost always entirely unique encounter around every corner.Of course, with combat this tight and inherently well-designed, the cracks are increasingly more obvious; in this case, unfortunately, a myriad of technical shortcomings. Between strikes not tracking properly, bosses launching entire combos in entirely the wrong direction, the camera completely losing its mind, bizarre hitboxes, and a whole smorgasbord of other smaller issues, It's tough to recall a single major fight that wasn't at least slightly soured by one of my big attacks randomly whiffing at a crucial moment or a spell failing to work as intended, yet still going on a lengthy cooldown regardless.There's no immunity to dubious design, either, particularly progression-side: most of the skill tree is superb, offering just about every improvement you could ever want for every aspect of the Destined One's moveset; however, you'll also find the bulk of your base stat increases taking all the same space, and the ensuing tug of war is a real early-game pain, your limited skill points forced not into what you want more, but rather what you can live without. Armour sets are equally questionable, boasting incredibly specific, build-defining set bonuses, but no way to upgrade and bring them with you until at least halfway through the game for no good reason.It's a similar story with exploration: between the visual splendour, the open, sweeping level design, and all the secrets and hidden nooks, it leaves quite the first impression, but the longer you spend in these spaces, the trickier it becomes to overlook their weaknesses, crude invisible walls everywhere you look, even more completely harmless yet agonisingly spongy enemies, all underpinned by a bizarre, stifling lack of a map. The main draw is ultimately the generally excellent range of optional side content—tonnes of extra bosses, little quests unlocking a new vendor or spell, and an utterly spellbinding secret ending, to name a few. They're sometimes a little too cryptic for their own good, but they're all very worth your time; each chapter has one chunkier side quest culminating in a whole additional sub-area and often a Vessel, an equipable active item primarily designed to counter the same chapter's final boss in immensely satisfying fashion.While I'm certainly painting a somewhat less euphoric picture than many of the other writings in this here review section, Black Myth Wukong's electrifying combat, its larger-than-life boss encounters, and the unbridled passion from the team behind it make for a title I strongly recommend.",True,
StarGale,99.3,"September 1, 2024",557,"After beating the game twice and seeing both endings, I can finally give it my personal assessment. This review contains spoilers and a considerable amount of bias, so take it with a grain of salt.It's an easy 9, or even 10, for me. With a triple-A budget pair with UE5, the graphical fidelity is impressive. While some have pointed out that stock assets are used to paint the environment, I honestly don't mind that much as long as they blend in well. Chapters 1 to 3 probably have the most distinguished biomes and stunning architecture. IIRC, the team 3D mapped a bunch of historical buildings and reconstructed them in-game. This approach is a breath of fresh air after playing Western AAA games for so many years. The animated mini-series from each chapter is also surprisingly well-made and unexpected; it gives the game a such unique character in terms of art direction.For those who have never read the classic Journey to the West, the plot might seem puzzling and confusing. I don't blame you; the narrative is scattered all over the place, and each chapter could be its own standalone story. For those who actually read the classic novel, the plot is just as baffling as everyone else. In fact, the world setting is only partially based on the original work. Black Myth's team has taken creative liberties to reinterpret Journey to the West based on another modern novel named ""Wu Kong"" and their previous Journey to the West MMO. The tone is much darker, the writing is edgier, and the underlying message is up to you to interpret. I only hope they can come up with a more coherent plot that stitches all the chapters together.For this section, I might need to break it into two parts: the Monkey itself and the rest of the mobs. The destined one has a very limited move set. Some weapons have their own variants added to the basic attack, but that's about all you get. The combat mechanic is relatively shallow and gets repetitive fast. There are some builds that synergize certain spirits with your gears, but the variety is still lackluster. On the contrary, I much prefer the enemy diversity. Although some re-skins exist, most still have their own move set and animation. There are a total of 55 mini-bosses and 26 bosses, which brings the total to 81. This odd number may not be apparent to some, but in the JttW novel, this is the exact number of tribulations they must endure to retrieve the scriptures. Interestingly, 81 is also the number of achievements on the PC end. I'm absolutely fond of the last fight with WuKong, with Erlang coming in a close second. Everyone and their mother has watched the 86 JttW TV series in China, and the amount of love and homage they put into the final battle is off the charts. This battle alone carries the entire Chapter 6, considering how bland the level design is otherwise. I couldn't think of a better boss fight in recent years. Yes, as I said before, I'm incredibly biased on this; the nostalgia hits differently.In its current state, I give it an 8.5. It is an excellent entry as their first AAA title. Although it has its flaws, a good game doesn't necessarily excel in every single aspect. The storytelling could be better because it doesn't complement how great the art direction is. At the same time, if they intend to create a semi-boss rush ARPG, I hope they can iron out the invisible walls in both level design and during combat, along with more in-depth combat mechanics to ensure both elements complement each other.",True,

Something about the lore, the story telling, the relatively deep RPG elements, the combat - it just feels so damn fun to play. Im half way through the game at the time of writing this review, but its just so much fun i had to add to the good vibes online for the game. THAT being said, does it drive anyone else crazy that the game doesn't have any terrain climbing mechanics? I know thats typical for a ""souls like"" game, but dude COME ON you are a Monkey king and you cant even climb a rock or a tree?!? - maybe in the sequel lol",True,
Michael Scott,79.6,"August 30, 2024",451,"This game is proof that a project doesn't need battle passes, paid cosmetics, or in-game shops to be successful. This is probably one of the most passionate games released in the past decade; the creativity and attention to detail are absolutely insane.Starting with one of the top selling points: the graphics. The graphics are absolutely absurd; Unreal Engine 5 is the best-looking engine on the market as of 2024, and this game makes very good use of it. Yes, using UE5 means that the game sometimes has some high optimization problems, although they're minor compared to other UE5 titles released recently.The combat and enemy variety in this game are simply absurd. Elden Ring is an amazing game, and even a game of that caliber still struggles to keep up with this game variety-wise. Every single enemy in this game is unique and original, with highly detailed models and movesets; there's only a very small amount of reused assets among the enemies and bosses. Some of the boss fights are creative enough to make your jaw drop. The game has a lot of different skills and movesets, transformations, and items to make the combat feel unique in each encounter. Although I gotta admit that I wish it had more spells.The biggest problem with this game compared to other action games is definitely the limitations on exploration of the map. This game has an absurd amount of invisible walls and limitations on the terrain blocking exploration, sometimes even on clear paths that look like they'd be explorable otherwise. And this is the reason i'm not giving this game a 10/10.The soundtrack fits very well with the theme of the game; the OSTs are magical and epic. Each chapter has an animation at the end with different art styles and music, with different stories and meanings. For a person who is not used to the main theme portrayed in this game, it's a magical experience for sure...I would definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in Chinese folklore and mythology. The story is amazing; I was totally unfamiliar with anything related to this theme, and after playing it, I gotta say I really want to know more about the general theme and meaning behind these stories.I genuinely believe this game will be remembered throughout the years as one of the most passionate and successful projects in gaming history.",True,

Wandering Cavalry,74.1,"September 13, 2024",380,"For a long time, whenever talking about China's game industry, it seems that countless players have sighed and lamented. Though its market value is tremendous and cannot be underestimated, the entire industry is almost supported by online and mobile games, and there are few achievements in AAA single-player games. In this context, August 20, 2024, would definitely be an unforgettable day for Chinese gamers. The future of Chinese single-player games, Black Myth: Wukong, has officially been released. On its first day, it has already reached a stunning 2.2 million players, and as of today, its total sales have reached 18 million copies, not only did it set a new first-week sales record among its genre, but also became the single-player game with the highest peak player count on steam. As the Chinese saying goes, 'A big tree attracts the wind'. While Black Myth: Wukong has won a large number of fans, it has also faced widespread questions and criticism. Can the quality of this game live up to such outstanding sales and an incredible number of players?Overall, Black Myth: Wukong is a work whose merits outweigh its flaws. Though its strengths and weaknesses are clear, we cannot dismiss it completely because of this. Games featuring traditional Chinese landscapes, realistic cultural scenes such as Buddha statues and temples, and Chinese Taoist Mythology are rare nowadays. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, this game showcases a level of visual refinement and scene interactivity that is beyond the reach of most previous AAA titles, the realistic and delicate scene interaction brings players an immersive gaming experience, and the stunning art is enough to allow players to indulge in this gorgeous world where every screenshot feels like wallpaper. Huge game worlds, rich game content, and a wide variety of enemies are ahead for players to explore, the game and combat in each chapter are unique and thrilling, the amazing music adds an immersive atmosphere to it, too. The movie-quality cutscenes are of extremely high standards in terms of camera movement and performance effects. The ending animations of each chapter, which are in different styles, are well-made and profound in connotation. Though the plot narrative technique is rather obscure and difficult to grasp, the in-game journal fully supplements the worldview, characters, and background in the form of fables or stories. Reading thoroughly will allow you to unravel the plot's complex themes. Countless talents and a wide range of spells for players to freely choose from, thus evolving into numerous genres of gameplay. The game's transformation mechanism is a major feature, combined with the character's flexible body movements and gorgeous battle performance effects, Black Myth: Wukong remains consistently entertaining and engaging in each battle. The final boss and the final hidden boss battles have put a lot of effort into the design of the mechanism, the battle scene, and the artistic conception conveyed. The upgradable that can freely reset and no death penalty have all greatly optimized the player's gaming experience, most players will not find the game overly difficult to complete.Whether in good or bad ways, this game draws heavily on the design of many souls-like games. Even though the plot of Black Myth: Wukong is extremely profound, the overly fragmented storytelling hinders player comprehension. The plot based on the conclusion of the Journey to the West, is very familiar to Chinese players, however, the lack of clear cause-and-effect explanations will likely confuse many others. The journal also contains a vast amount of text, not all players may have the patience to finish it, let alone delve into the original Journey to the West. While the Chinese voice acting is excellent, the English voice acting feels a little lackluster, and misplaced and missing subtitles also show that Black Myth: Wukong still needs to improve in terms of localization. The developer may aim to encourage players to get rid of guides and explore on their own, but in a vast world with interconnected routes, extremely low scene recognition, and high similarity, without route guides and in-game maps, it is very easy to lose your sense of direction when actually playing. The frequent appearance of invisible walls since the third chapter makes it even more difficult for players to judge the true boundaries of the map. Player would find it hard to experience the complete game content without a guide. The numerous skills and transformations vary significantly in strength, the character's fragile ability to withstand attacks also makes the game have relatively high requirements on the player's reaction ability and operational tolerance. The optimization of Black Myth: Wukong is extremely poor, with problems such as long loading time, frame drops, and crashes often occurring. In terms of the lighting transition between light and dark scenes, and the lighting effects in dark scenes, Black Myth: Wukong also performs extremely poorly. The design of the large bosses in the game, such as Captain wise-voice and The duskveil is problematic, the battle experience is frustrating. The design of the probability of dropping some collectibles is even worse, and compared to the earliest gameplay trailer, the officially released version has cut too much content. Even in the existing chapters, many story elements feel abrupt and lack depth, leaving too many gaps. Although the fifth and sixth chapters are also quite good, they are inferior to the previous chapters, and signs of development rush are extremely obvious. In a market lacking AAA titles, Game Science has made unremitting efforts and delivered Black Myth: Wukong in 4 years, which is no small feat. Whether through its unique, realistic, and excellent art, or its satisfying and exhilarating comfort, it will definitely make you indulge in it. If you take the time and savor it quietly, you will definitely be shocked and leave endless aftertaste. It should be noted that no matter how good a game is, it will eventually have its audience, and this is especially true for Black Myth: Wukong as an action role-playing game. As the saying goes, 'seeing is believing.' if you can accept the shortcomings mentioned above, you still need to experience it for yourself to understand its mystery. In the end, Black Myth: Wukong still benefits the vast majority of players on three major levels: in terms of game aesthetics, its success stands in stark contrast to the dismal ending of Concord, which implements political correctness and diversified aesthetics, and will inevitably sound the alarm for the art design of future games; in terms of the game engine, Black Myth: Wukong further demonstrates the massive potential of the Unreal 5 engine, more developers will likely turn to it for game development, which will surely bring games with more stunning visual effects and improved optimization in the future; in the Chinese game industry, the huge success of Black Myth: Wukong has overturned the previous monopoly of online games and mobile games in the market. The potential of single-player games will inevitably drive more Chinese developers to invest in it. Even if you discover that this game isn't to your liking, its popularity will surely bear fruit in the future and will be beneficial to the entire gaming industry.",True,
King Bradley,104.7,"September 27, 2024",348,"This game is based on the novel Journey to the West. Sun Wukong is the main protagonist of that journey, and I would advise watching some summary before playing the game, to understand how insane he is and what he did. He was also an inspiration for Goku. I didn't tag this game as Souls-like because I don't think it is. When you die, you don't lose ""souls"". Lore is way more detailed and not as hidden as in Souls games where you need to read item descriptions and listen to NPCs. Here most of the lore is found by just killing new enemies which unlock new entry in the journal. There are no stats like strength, dexterity etc. instead you have skill trees with so many things to upgrade. Also if you explore everything this game will be easier than Souls games most of the time. Black Myth: Wukong is the game on its own, the epic game for itself.The first thing you can notice when you start this game is that in only a few seconds you are greeted by some colossal beings. I was amazed as soon as the game started, and the prologue itself is absolutely incredible. Slight spoiler, but in prologue you play as Sun Wukong, and after that game is divided into 6 chapters, where you are playing as Destined One years later trying to ""wake up"" Sun Wukong. Every time you kill a new enemy you will get some journal entry, which is a short story which has references to the Chinese folklore or Journey to the West, and reading these stories is necessary to understand the story. Sometimes I had to google, because the names were not explained. These stories are also usually very interesting, but there are so many of them so I would advise on reading them as soon as you get them, cause they can pile up. There are around 200 in total and some of them are connected where story continues from one entry to another.The story itself is pretty interesting, and there are a lot of amazing cutscenes. Each of the first 5 chapters features a new story set in some new world. Each of these chapters has some main ""villain"" that you need to beat to get the rune.When I first started playing this game, after overwhelming prologue, chapter 1 felt a bit rushed and kinda underwhelming, because if you don't read those journal entries the whole chapter will feel like the boss rush, but after some time I started liking it. Chapter 2 is definitely way bigger and opens way more, however it's a big desert, so it can get tiring. Chapter 3 is where things got very interesting and very confusing, because it is so big, and it branches so much. At first it felt okay, but then I reached a big forest with snow everywhere, and everything looked similar, you could go anywhere, like in 15 directions. Thankfully with those journal entries you can see if you missed something. And when I was done with this forest there was some temple area, which as well was really really big, and had so much going on, that the whole chapter was very confusing, even though it was very interesting story-wise. It is also the longest chapter in the game. Chapter 4 is also very long and it is probably one of the best when it comes to story, but it is a bit gloomy. Chapter 5 was kinda short, and it was mostly fighting bosses, but it was as well a pretty interesting chapter with interesting story line. Chapter 6 is very different from all other chapters, you are just going around and searching for some bosses, trying to find some items before fighting the final boss.The first 5 chapters also feature secret areas which I would advise beating, since most of the time they will make the end boss of the chapter much easier with some new item that you got, and they are also very interesting. The game also features 2 endings, and to get true ending you will need to beat all these secret areas.Throughout the game there are so many bosses and mini-bosses to beat, I think I have beaten over 100 of them, but I definitely beat them all since I got all journal entries in the game. Most of these bosses took me few tries most, and a lot of them can actually be considered mini-bosses, and those mini-bosses sometimes leave spirits which you can collect and summon later while fighting. It can be a bit overwhelming to fight bosses all the time, but eventually I got used to it, and since I mostly beat them all on first or second try, it felt like fighting regular enemies eventually. The problem with fighting so many bosses is that rarely any boss will be memorable. If you explore everything and you are ""good"" at Souls games you will not have problems with this game. Only one boss in this game which is necessary to beat to get true ending took me a lot of tries, I think I needed a few hours. Boss is so epic and hard, and in my personal experience it's 2nd hardest boss from all bosses I've ever fought including all Souls games.Combat is just incredible, it's so fun, one of the best I have seen. Destined One is wielding staff so fast, and he is so fast that you can just dodge anything and you need to dodge all the time. You also need to make the best use of spells that you get through the game. One spell will let you freeze the enemy for few seconds. One spell will make duplicates of you for few seconds which help you fight. I mentioned already that you will be able to call spirits, and you will also be able to transform. Transformations regenerate over time, as well as spirits (when you fight you get KI which regenerates spirits), but spells cost mana, and until you rest again at shrine you will not get mana back, so prepare to become good with your staff. Overall combat is just amazing, incredibly fun.In addition to combat, there are shrines on which you can rest, fast travel etc., and while fighting you earn skill points which you can use to upgrade your abilities. You can also restart these abilities at any point on any shrine. You can travel from chapter to chapter at any point in the story. You can also craft armor and staff that you get from fighting bosses, and use some items to help you make game easier.Game took me around ~65h to beat all bosses, get all journal entries and get most of the achievements. You can't get all achievements in the first run, so you must play ng+ for the rest of them, however ng+ is pretty easy. Only problem is that some achievements require farming. There aren't many NPCs side quests, but there a lot of characters. Performance wise a lot of people complain, and I also had issues which I fixed by using FSR instead of DLSS and frame generation on. I managed to get my game running completelly smooth, stutter free, but I had insane stutter at first.- One of the best openings in the games I've ever seen- Incredibly fun combat- Journal entries are so interesting- Cutscenes are amazing- Most bosses are unique, and there are many good bosses- Pretty good story and everything about Sun Wukong is so interesting- Chapter 3 can be a bit confusing to explore, it can feel like it's easy to miss stuff, but on the other hand chapter itself is really interesting- Chapter 6 introduces new ability, but it also feels so random, just searching for bosses- Having to search the internet for explanation of some characters that are not in the game Just an incredible game, my personal GOTY of the 2024 so far, and of the best and most fun games I've ever played. I liked it so much that I ordered The Journey to the West books. This is definitely one of my new favorite games, and I felt so overwhelmed when I finished it. I would advise getting true ending, cause it's worth it. If chapters 3 and 6 had a bit better design I would consider this game a masterpiece, but it's really close.",True,
DawnAnvil,82.5,"August 19, 2024",333,"Best graphics I've ever played in a game with rtx 4090, also the story is great if you read or watch the TV show of Journey to the West beforehand.",True,
' Æsir,83.6,"September 4, 2024",306,"Black Myth: Wukong was released under a lot of anticipation after gameplay showcases had been shown over the past few years, leading people to even question if the game would really come out like that. Thankfully, it really did – and overcame all expectations. The game is engaging, well made, fluid, has a fair dose of difficulty, is downright beautiful and is worth every penny and time you put into it.I honestly find it hard to catch up with the story – at least without any knowledge on the classical Chinese novel The Journey To The West, where the developers have taken inspiration from. Still, that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy the game, especially during a second playthrough.The game isn’t the classical novel itself, but inspired by it. It’s set after Sun Wukong’s disappearance/death after his fight against the Celestial Court – event that serves as a prologue. You play as a monkey warrior referred to as The Destined One, who journeys through the land to recover Sun Wukong’s six relics, which were scattered across the land, in order to try to bring the famous monkey back to life.It feels amazing! Black Myth: Wukong is a third person game that you can label under the soulslike banner. However, that doesn’t mean it has an excruciating difficulty. It’s more of a friendly soulslike with some elements of hack and slash – enemies are usually difficult, bosses are challenging, but you won’t lose anything if you die. It might take you some time to beat some bosses, but you eventually end up succeeding. The more you venture into the game, the better you get because you are earned more resources to fight, as well as you get naturally better at playing it. There practically aren’t hordes of enemies like in a hack and slash game, so you won’t be swarmed.A magical iron staff is your main weapon, but there are also magical skills, transformations, three difference stances, potions to temporarily enhance your abilities and a skill tree to spend your points on according to your playstyle. There won’t be enough points (sparks) to buy all abilities, so be wise and understand what your playstyle is and don’t waste sparks on things you don’t use – although it’s possible to reattribute them.Among the things that make this game appealing is the fluid combat. It’s not sluggish, floaty and clunky as most soulslike games. The movements are beautiful and fast-paced, satisfying to perform. And the bosses hardly ever have the same movements. They are pretty much all unique, which adds to the game. So you don’t feel you are facing a repetition of a previous boss under new skin, except for the elemental frogs.Black Myth: Wukong is a ‘new’ generation game like no other. It features the best and most advanced technologies out there, and applies them very well. It’s not a poorly optimized game – it indeed is a heavy one. But even if you lower the presets, you are still going to have a beautiful game.The game doesn’t survive on good graphics alone. I could say it’s absolutely one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played. The details in the scenarios, the architecture, the clothes, the weapons, with all the rich Chinese ornamentations… how well detailed the enemies are when it comes to appearance, movements, attacks… how varied everything is… You can spend a lot of time just gazing at details, which contributes a lot to your immersion. Well, I could spend all day long listing how incredible the details are. Game Science didn’t have any laziness.Of course, there are flaws. The game is so incredible to the point that the flaws aren’t a deal breaker, but they’re so silly they shouldn’t be there.The most alarming of all are the invisible walls. Wukong is full of them, even at unnecessary places! We’re not talking about a totally linear game – there are areas of (semi) open world. It means there shouldn’t be invisible walls, even inside monk temples where you could walk to the temple wall. But you can’t because there’s another invisible wall before it. When it happens, it breaks the immersion a little bit.Another grave one is the simply terrible lip sync. That disturbs our enjoyment a lot if we pay attention to it rather than notice other graphical elements. That's why I stopped looking at their mouths and began admiring the rest. They haven't used any AI to lip sync with English, so the English voiceover doesn't match the Chinese lip movements. Embarrassing.Also, some lighting issues sometimes occur. When you walk into a new area, for instance, you may experience light sources changing, just popping from dark to clear sunlight all of a sudden, like inside some caves or other places in the desert.I’ve also experienced enemies, NPCs and other elements popping in front of me in the scenarios, less frequently though. Maybe it could have been due to hours of session straight.At least three or four times, I was forced to close the game and rerun it after some lags and huge fps drops – also after long hours of gameplay straight. You see, I got 32GB RAM, but maybe the game uses it so much that the memories are unable to erase unnecessary information. But, rerunning the game always fixed it.It’s not any game that has some flaws yet its strengths eclipse them. The flaws don’t ruin your experience, and you definitely should play this game. Wukong is one of those games you can’t miss and will make you have an unforgettable experience.Black Myth: Wukong is not groundbreaking, it doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but proves that if devs really want to create a game with competence and passion – and above all, a game that is supposed to be what it is: a videogame! –, they deliver wonderful experiences.The price tag is fair for such a masterpiece. You don’t need to wait for sales. Grab it!",True,

SoulSteppe,106.7,"August 19, 2024",237,"Black Myth Wukong has made its Journey to the West.Destined Ones! Come hear my wisdom in my review of the wonderful game Black Myth Wukong!Black Myth Wukong is a legendary game by the Chinese studio Game Science. It is a game you should buy and experience at least once in your gaming career. You the player watch as the namesake Wukong gets up from his respite and fight Erlang, a boss sent to punish Wukong. Erlang uses a spell that causes a headache for Wukong, for whom he is defeated. As a result, the main character is another monkey who wields a staff so he can find the necessary items to resurrect Wukong from his frozen place, so he can be whole again. The story line establishes it self quite nicely. The Destined One label affixes itself to a monkey set out to find each of the 6 relics so that 6 senses can be employed to resurrect the legendary Sun Wukong. I have noticed a bunch of things that made my experience amazing. Environment and graphics are amazing. Clearly, much effort went into the creation of the environment that they look realistic and borderline uncanny valley in a good way; it is as if real like was digitized and made digital, with blades of grass looking amazing. Each environment draws me in the places that I spent a lot of time wanting to explore and relax there. I love it so so much and I spent so much time everywhere. It is like the gold standard of how to do things. A+. The wonders of Unreal Engine is exemplified through this game in the environments. I really liked how pretty the first level was with the shrines, grass, water and how well done it was. The original soundtrack proves its worth in a game such as this game, and worth a long listen. Most are instrumental in nature but well crafted for each moment. Each setting is well done and fully engrosses me into the moment so much so that I am not distracted. Piano, classical instruments, all so darn good. Chinese cultural instruments at work. The theme song Celestial Symphony, which is based on the theme song of the 1986 television series Journey to the West, which itself has been viewed by plenty of people in China, me included. I wanted to mention the character design are solidly well done. From characters such as the Sisters, to the individual secondary one that appear and to the random Yaoguai that appear, they are wonderfully done to the point where, it is amazing and not distracting. Tiger Vanguard is one. The Sisters are the best done in game. Two women worked in conjunction with one serving as the motion capture, and face model, and another as the voice. All are beautiful and Second Sister especially the looker.  The individual who brought Erlang to life is a great example of how well do to stuff. Looks polished and well done.Combat feels great, smooth, and addicting to engage. A variety of weapons avail themselves to the Destined One, and spells, and spirits. The Destined Ones can transform into various forms so that they can deal with enemies quite efficiently. One form can be used for one type of enemy and another for a separate type of enemy.The stances are the exemplary ones. There are quite a few versatile stuff that can be used. For example, I mostly used an aggressive combat heavy style that focused on damage dealing, which were efficient with assaulting yaoguai. Then there were defensive ones and agile ones that were useful for the Chiefs that were useful for bosses. I feel that if I didn’t use some of them, I would have died already. The combat system is the massive stand out aspect. Truly a masterpiece. I also liked the way that that shrines were used as a method of saving, resting, and a point of convenience. Every time I got it one, it was a nice marker on the map where it auto saved for me. Additionally, I can use a spell to teleport back to that point, so I can rest, prayer, and readjust stuff to continue on. It is also useful to get around the map to get through some of the objectives. This fast travel proves it self so convenient and I love it. A few things I noticed that could need massive improvement. First Minimap-A minimap needs to exist in game. When I’m playing, I want to know where on the map, and where to go. On some maps, it feels like a clue is needed to know where to go, but ends up going in circles or somewhere else unintended, and thus lost. Therefore, a minimap could make game life a bit easierSecond - Invisible WallsThe so-called “invisible walls”, that is, natural environment that are built so well that seem like it is part of the actual game boundaries of the world in-game, since it is built it is built so well that it blends in. A few times, I would walk somewhere, thinking it can be traversed, but cannot be done so. My argument goes back to the mention of a minimap earlier; the presence of one can help with the constant boundary crashes.Comments about the game in general. The game is based on Journey to the West, albeit an inspiration with the setting and characters based on it. I read the book years ago, and re-read it as a refresher recently. It was a great read with loads of fantasy. I read the book and found lots of good things in the game that were borrowed directly from the book. Like Erlang, the Celestial court, and the Tiger Vanguard. The spiders and supposed husband. Those characters are done well. I love it. Another interesting about the game are the music videos. After each chapter, there is a music video that plays at the end, and is accessible on the title screen. Each has some relation, if at all, to the plot of the chapter, and they tell a sentimental story of love, or change. Quite beautiful in telling. One thing that needs to change are English subtitles so that literally everyone can understand them, so it is not locked behind a particular language. Despite that, it is a neat thing to have in the game, and a bonus that really enhances the game so much. Black Myth Sequels. One thing that stuck out to me was the name. The Primary name Black Myth with subtitle “Wukong” feels like it could be room for more content under the name. It could be more stories with another monkey or stories that can be enriched afterwards, which I don’t doubt. I have some ideas but probably not come to fruition. Instead lets keep an eye out for it later on. Overall, it has come to my judgment on whether to recommend or not. In SummaryThis game is my personal game of the Year, no doubt. No other game released in 2024 comes close to this majesty of a game. It’s grandeur and splendor has captivated my attention for the better of 80+ hours, and it has sent me on a trip with my time.I recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a fantastic action game. I’m am glad that the game has made its Journey to the West.",True,

Funbugalow,77.5,"August 20, 2024",176,"As I face the reality of my terminal illness diagnosis, This game has become a rare light in my life. Growing up I found comfort in the unforgiving challenge and beauty of soulslike games, and now, in what may be my final months, this game has given me a chance to reconnect with that comfort one last time.The developers have created a visually stunning and mechanically precise action RPG that offers both the challenge and the sense of achievement that we crave. The intricate combat, alongside the visually striking environments, makes every moment memorable. It’s given me something to look forward to, allowing me to lose myself in its rich world when I need it most.If you're a fan of soulslike games and appreciate the art of a well crafted challenge, I can't recommend Black Myth: Wukong enough.

Tren God Trent,54.4,"October 24, 2024",174,"This game in my opinion should be game of the year. Healing can be a bit unresponsive as it does not delay the input if you get knocked down and try to take a quick swig while getting back up but once you get past that it's a really amazing game. Great story and a world inspired by Chinese mythology and The Journey to the West. I really liked the perfect dodge system and the ability to change my build at any resting point to really let me try everything out. I fought every boss, meditated in every location, and met all the characters for the journal and I enjoyed the entire experience. Baije was amazing and really added a lot to the Destined One's journey; I think his last few lines of dialogue in the game was my favorite part. It is not as challenging as FROM software titles but to me it played a lot like Elden Ring with its own unique style and I had a lot of fun with it.

Raden,17.4,"August 20, 2024",147,"Black Myth: Wukong is a game I've eagerly anticipated for what feels like an eternity, and it doesn't disappoint. This title perfectly captures the essence of a classic hack and slash experience, evoking memories of the golden PS3 era. The gameplay is smooth, satisfying, and relentless, offering the kind of visceral combat that fans of the genre will instantly fall in love with.What makes Black Myth: Wukong stand out even more is its scale. The game doesn't just pit you against a handful of enemies; it throws you into epic, sprawling battles that feel monumental. The sense of grandeur in each fight, the vast environments, and the formidable foes all contribute to a game that feels as massive as the legend it’s based on.Speaking of legends, the story is rooted in the already incredible tale of the Monkey King, one of the most beloved characters in Chinese folklore. The narrative pulls you in, blending myth with a dark, fantastical world that is both enchanting and terrifying. Black Myth: Wukong doesn't just tell the story; it makes you live it, putting you in the shoes or rather, the fur of one of the most iconic characters in mythology.However, it's frustrating to see the double standards in the industry when it comes to discussing diversity and inclusion in video games. Screen Rant, for example, has been criticized for targeting only Asian games with accusations of lacking diversity titles like Stellar Blade, Genshin Impact, and now Black Myth: Wukong.And honestly, what kind of diversity are people expecting from a game about a stone monkey fighting demons? There are literally no humans in sight, not even Chinese characters, because the story is rooted in myth, not in modern social narratives. Yet somehow, some still find things to complain about, pushing Western agendas into places they simply don't belong.Edit: Wow the game reached 2.2 Million player, becoming one of the most played single player game ever. This is the result of making game for the sake of making game, instead of making a game for political agenda.",True,

CB20XX,57.2,"August 20, 2024",136,"A very ambitious, refreshing action-RPG that focuses on cinematic action and hyper dynamic combat while doing away with the usual open world fluff that has gotten way out of control since the mid 2010's.Its a little linear, cut in straightforward chapters and contained areas, almost in a retro / nostalgic way, but it really doesn't miss a beat thanks to stunning, epic cutscenes and frenetic, unique boss fights, constantly pushing the player forwards through the chapters, yearning for more.  Sometimes pushing a little too far ahead, to the detriment of the story while at other times offering up some incredible characters and lore along with touching moments... And lots of research to do on Journey to the West and Chinese mythology.Combat is speedy and dynamic although quite precise and usually pretty clean / readable. It sometimes turns messy because of weird camera movements and even weirder hitboxes. A somewhat uneven localisation (at least in English)  and a frustrating amount of invisible walls. Definitely old-school .It's spent a very long time cooking and ultimately feels like a pretty great first step in Chinese AAA gaming.",True,

Resty,54.4,"September 11, 2024",83,"Steam Deck Playability ( 7/10)GOTF ? (100/10) !!DLSS MOD USESteam Deck LCD ReviewSo, after extensive research on trying to play this game without too much an issue. Playing it with so called DLSS MOD is VERY RECOMMENDED. Seeing many people saying about how this will struggle in Chapter 2 on forth especially on tiger vanguard and other bosses. I would say, this game can run perfectly by using the mod I mention above. Chapter 1 PreviewStarting from the prologue, i have a bit of problem with the graphics but that all changed after the Prologue. Graphics from Steam Deck is as people know is ALL Set to LOW. However, i set Texture to HIGH because i still can run it great without impacting the performance by a lot. Take in mind, i am using the DLSS MOD. Therefore the Frame Generation is on. In my Steam Settings also i enable Allow Tearing, and Manual GPU Clock set to 1600 MHz with Scaling Filter FSR set to 3 Sharpness. I experiment a lot with this and doing as above, i actually got very good looking graphics with acceptable performance, getting almost 60 fps stable except sometime it might drop to 55-59 or lower depend on the location. However my play in Chapter 1 is almost perfect and i like it very much.Starting from Chapter 2 Above, I set Texture back to low, because there is pixelated environment and stuttering keep happening. However, i manage to run it stable in 60 fps so it worth the sacrifice. There is still stuttering sometime but i guess this is because loading the environment and so on. My fight with all the bosses does not affect anything much. No lagging input like people mention which is weird. Probably just me, but i am glad everything went smooth .To put it simply, running DLSS MOD imo is just important if you want to try play in Steam Deck. Take note i also run CryoUtilities and also Wukong with Latest Proton GE-11. This is also been done in Steam Deck LCD. So i dont see how OLED cant run better than this unless you do something wrong. I hope there is optimization been done to make it much better and no need of DLSS MOD. My Steam Deck Settings: Frame Limit 60 FPSAllow TearingManual GPU Clock 1600MHzScaling Filter FSR ( Sharpness 3)Game Resolution ( Set in Properties ) = 1280x720 If you use DLSS MOD , Perhaps using lower can improve the performance ( Need testing) []IN-Game SettingsPrefer All Low, OFF everything OFF like V-Sync and Motion Blur for Smooth gameplay. Can make Exception for Texture to set to HIGH depend if you can run it much better or want to sacrfice some performance. Prefer to set to low in Chapter 2 above because just how big the environment is. From my gameplay and research , WUKONG IS ONE OF A MUST HAVE for HandHeld Console . Of course there is many room for improvement which i hope the dev consider to do so for Steam Deck. I have not being sleeping playing this game for a day and looking for the best way to experience on Steam Deck. For those who have problem with this game being unplayable, try to get the DLSS MOD like i mention and try to do more research just like what i did. You wont regret it !!",True,

Surprisingly lots of hidden secrets and side quests, best part is you can backtrack and do all the side quest even after completing the chapter.9/10 would be nice if we have more exploration instead of linear progression path but this is just personal preferences. Also Chapter 4 is peak.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update after 100hours of playtime: I've completed pretty much everything the game can offer, except maxing out all Spirits and Equipments (you need about NG+5 to get enough Knot of Voidness for all Spirits upgrade). I like how the game gives you a secret stance but require a lot of work for it, too bad it can't last long (That's what she said).You definitely don't need to do new playthrough but highly recommend trying out NG+1 as you get some new stuff to play with. The scaling for NG+3 onwards is a bit 'unbalanced' as you pretty much hit the cap of scaling of your damage/defence but enemies/bosses just scale harder than you, which can makes it a bit unfun.Still a great game, prob GOTY 2024 for me.",True,

There's a whole level up system that can be used to power up your abilities and spells which can be used in subsequent battles.

RCascade1996,74.1,"August 22, 2024",66,"Very good game. Runs well. I like the boss fights, there's a lot of them. I would like to say more about the game's narrative in which so little people are discussing.The story is a very good twist to the Wukong narrative which has the protagonist journey through different places to gather the 6 relics of The Great Sage (Sun Wukong) to bring him back from the dead. Each Chapter feels like a philosophical Buddhist dialogue about characters that have failed to follow in the steps of Buddha due to their earthly nature. There are beautiful movie shorts that play at the end of each chapter that adds a layer of narrative to the characters and the places you visit. Best way to describe it is like if Elden Ring showed you a movie before everything went to ♥♥♥♥. Theres also a mural with an old wise man narrator making philosophical commentary on the tragic characters that you meet (and fight) during your journey which is a really nice touch. There is some humour to be found that these characters are in stark contrast to Wukong's effortless attainment of Buddhahood in which he later regretted due to having missed the simple joys of life. This fuels the thematic conflict that is pervasive in this game; Man's desire to transcend the Earth and escape the tragedy of this world, as opposed to giving in to Earthly desires and all the things, both good and bad, attached to it. This is a very tonally consistent game with a very subtle, introspective emotional delivery (similar to Elden Ring). Music is used at a minimum here, with it only really playing during boss fights. Despite music not being used often, it is effective when it is (especially in Chapter 2). It is so unlike western games that are more overt with its delivery of narrative mood. Games like God of War 2016 uses music more heavily and changes mood according to the scene being showed. It also easy to tell when scenes in God of War are trying to be humorous due to me knowing the language. In Wukong, it is very hard to tell the humour apart due to me not knowing Chinese language and culture. I can tell people will have a different experience of this game whether if you're from China or not but this is just how the game made me feel.I played the game in English VA to really get the emotional aspect that the narrative is trying to deliver. Whether it is true to the Chinese vibe, i do not know. All in all, it is a very fun game. 9/10",True,

Twiig,82.1,"August 30, 2024",64,"Really enjoyed my journey through this title! Combat feels really great with the stance swapping mechanics. If you like boss fights, this is the game for you, with there being like 90+ for you to conquer. Some more challenging than others, but all are unique and memorable for you to tackle again on your next playthrough in NG+. Everything in this game works well together; the spirts, spells, vessels…all of them made for some really cool variety in gameplay. The ability to change your build on the fly is a huge plus and I loved the chapter-to-chapter format of the story. Animated cutscene story tales were an awesome touch to bring each chapter to a close. Most of all, I loved finding all the hidden areas and questlines along the way, figuring out secret items and bosses that you might not run into without exploring. All of the achievements were fun to go after, collecting all items and defeating every enemy to complete your journal is an awesome feeling to accomplish.

Spicy Sweet Chili,61.2,"September 5, 2024",61,"I’m happy to say that this game was worth the wait. Everything from the amazing set pieces, combat, characters, and attention to detail were just breathtaking to me. It’s so clear that there was a ton of love poured into this game, so many little nods and extra effort put into even the little things that you cant help but be charmed by it all.It’s very polished, only occurred a couple minor bugs throughout my playthroughs, and once you figure out how the game works and the map progression plays out, it’s very rewarding and plays through smoothly. I will say though, the idea of stances is fun - but I never found much of a reason to swap from the default smash stance and just crank out the big damage.I don’t really have too many complaints besides the combat being a little spammy, but that kind of works because it lets you focus instead on learning to react to the bosses, rather than managing a ton of complex mechanics on your end.I 100% the game because I enjoyed the game so much.

CountryCount,30.6,"August 22, 2024",426,"Unlike most people who reviewed this game after 30 minutes and declared it GOTY, i actually played the game.TLDR: Fun at the start, get repetitive really fast and overstays its welcome, with a bunch of glitches and graphical errors.Graphics and performance: Beautiful, but also really buggy, crashed multiple times, and when moving my character had a constant silhouette of artifacts which were really distracting. At least it had very little frame drops most of the time on a XTX7900 and an AMD 7800X3D.Gameplay: Basically this is a boss rush game. Nothing more, nothing less. Combat is pretty to look at, basically stays the same for the whole game. Maybe that is why people hype it so much because it is fun at the start but gets boring real quick. Around 95% of the bosses are one shot pushovers which you will have forgotten about 5 minutes after killing them. The other 5% are just frustrating to fight because they were so badly designed especially the later game fights where every boss has at least 2 health bars as well as transition phases that make then immune to you but they will still attack you which go on for far too long. Also mechanics wise they have a lot of very similar moves e.g. basically every later game boss has a move that puts them above your head and makes them shoot a multitude of projectiles at you. Just very repetitive all around.Also game would have really benefited from some sort of map.Story: Know Journey to the west or don't bother trying to understand who the characters in the game are or what you are doing besides ""get all the monkey king relics"".EDIT: Forgot to mention the absolutely terrible skill tree.

Ivor Spatch,4.2,"August 22, 2024",343,"Black Myth: Wukong is not the game that you think it is. The opening is strong, with gorgeous visuals, incredible art direction and mystifying enemy and boss design. The problems begin however when the introduction is over and the real game begins. Black Myth Wukong dresses itself as an RPG but this is only superficial. In reality, Black Myth Wukong is a Boss Rush. There's very little downtime between boss fights, often moving directly from one fight into another. When there is something in-between, the game offers only linear levels with nothing in the way of exploration.That's not to say that the game isn't entirely without merit. Visually the game is a feast for the eyes, and the music and sound design are top quality. The combat system is as visually pleasing as it is mechanically deep, there's an array of skills, spells, transformations, items and equipment at the players disposal.However, this variety is hampered by the totally linear progression, armour and weapons are not found in the game world, they are unlocked in the shop after an arbitrary amount of progress has been made. Likewise for spells and skills which are only unlocked after specific points of the story. This leaves the game severely lacking in player agency, there's no decision making in where to go or in what order you progress the story, each ""level"" of the game is a beautifully decorated corridor with a boss waiting for you at the end and even within a scant few hours, the shallow game-play loop becomes immediately apparent. The boss rush nature of the game falls flat without the framing behind it. Bosses that have fantastic visual design have no framing within the story, there's little to no lore or explanation behind the enemies you're facing and it can leave you erratically jumping from one quirky boss fight to another with a feeling of disconnect. Without this framing, the significance of the boss is lost and what could have been a grandiose fight becomes a pedestrian affair, each boss becomes just another box to tick on your road to the end of the game.Black Myth: Wukong is a spectacle, for sure, but it feels like it's using that spectacle as a crutch to distract from how little depth there to the gameplay, it feels like all of the mechanics of a good RPG were created, they just forgot to create the world to go with it.",False,

raw maw,1.6,"August 20, 2024",312,"Is Black Myth: Wukong the best game ever made and ever will be made? ...... .A sudden uproar of positive feedback for this game brings me here.People claiming insane quality with immense praise, and already bursting out with GOTY trophies left and right.""The most beautiful-looking game ever"", ""A technological wonderland"" and other absurd claims alike. Hyping it up as if it's 1993 and DOOM just released.So, I was intrigued -- if not a little enticed. I've read the gameplay described as not too dissimilar of the Dark Souls games and Sekiro, with others mentioning God of War from 2018. I'm really not a large fan of either, to say it politely. But I wouldn't have encountered many of my favourite games if I weren't open-minded.Either way, I was mostly interested in the highly-praised visuals of the game......And I am disappointed.Don't get me wrong, the aesthetic of the game looks  -- but the vaseline textures, low-poly rocks with extremely stretched details, dittered hair, AO flicker on foliage, and some sort of constant film-grain filter plus intense sharpening effect is just killing it for me. I've seen games from over 6 years ago look vastly better than this.The whole game just looks like a blurry, fuzzy mess. Yes, even after turning off motion-blur and all that default crap, yadda yadda yadda.Performance is okay for a UE5 title, but it looks nowhere near the """" trailers they've shown, and quite frankly the overall picture doesn't look good enough to justify the performance.I'm certain similar fidelity could be achieved in UE3 for a fraction of CPU/GPU resource cost.Playing with a i9-14900KF, RTX 4080 Super, and 64GB RAM; on all the highest settings with full RTX on... and performance is most definitely playable, but what's on screen doesn't really aptly translate to the tankiness of the game. Maybe that's due to the integrated Denuvo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The 130GB installation is just wild, honestly. Compare that to Elden Ring's 50GB. I mean, the complaint writes itself. No way the contents of the game have in any way been sorted and optimized, especially with its low-res texture fidelity.I don't wanna be a Twitter guy and whine about in-game graphics, but I'm just not seeing the substance of all these crazy claims fans are making.Still, if the game's good then I probably wouldn't complain about its visuals. But it isn't.Gameplay is a monotonous button-masher with little-to-no positively noteworthy aspects.Normal enemies are weak as ♥♥♥♥ and even a dog with the controller in its mouth could accidentally kill them, no sweat.Bosses are mostly just consistent of spamming dodge, since they have very bad tells and 0-frame attacks from across the arena that stunlock you in an infinite loop. And the intervals between dodges are taken up by slowly waiting for magic to go off cooldown, just like God of War (2018). With spells that make you immortal or another that immobilizes the enemy, it's nothing but hand-holding.Normal attacks are a waste to bother with, as the 3rd consecutive light attack has such a long delay that it's easier to just dash after the 2nd to reset it. And heavy attacks are so tediously wonky to pull-off and take forever to do that there's zero reason to ever do such a thing mid-battle.The healing mechanic has such a large delay that it's hard to immediately know whether the game even registered your input, so I end up accidentally doing multiple heals at once.Areas are extremely linear in progression, and actively discourages any of the basic yet optional side-explorations by filling each room with illogically placed invincible walls. So you're never really sure where you can go and where you can't.The game's camera is somehow even worse than any FromSoftware's titles, which is not a prideful achievement.It will shuffle and twitch around like it's a scene from Cloverfield.And if as much as a twig get in the way, it will zoom in for a thorough colonoscopy.Also, the story is boring as ♥♥♥♥, and the English voice-acting is absolutely horrid and on-par with Atomic Heart.I'm not sure whether I could comfortably classify this game as ""bad"", but I certainly would not recommend it as my short time with it was truly agonizing. I'm no longer interested in playing any more, so... .",False,

I went in with no expectations or hype whatsoever, and frankly I don't get it.The game has terrible level design, you are bound to hit an invisible wall (even if the place you are trying to reach is part of the level, sometimes there's just an invisible wall to prevent you from going there from a specific angle for some reasons) no matter where you go, the paths are also not intuitive, I was actually going around the level trying to find what I had missed only to find out that there was a small gap to crawl in to progress hidden inside a cave, there was nothing to tell me this was there, I found it by pure chance, the combination of the invisible walls, non-intuitive levels and the lack of a map to find those paths on makes exploring very frustrating.The combat feels wrong, sometimes you do an input mid-roll and the character does the move related to that input right after the roll, and sometimes he does not, heavy attacks have ridiculous delay to them which makes them feel terrible to use. In some fights, you could start a heavy attack before the boss starts his attack and get punished anyway. You barely do any damage to bosses and kill regular enemies way too easily, which makes the bosses the only actual challenge, well except for actually finding them, unfortunately the bosses have terrible arena designs and sometimes attack fast enough to get you with a follow-up attack right after your dodge.

It runs pretty well and combat looks pretty good so far but bosses, which seems to be the main focus of the game, doesn't work properly.Edit: After like five tries the boss AI worked and I finished the fight. But later on unsurprisingly out of 6 bosses or so 2 of them also stopped fighting midfight and 1 of them refused to die. I tried that boss again 3 more times to no avail. I literally cannot continue the game. Some people have no problems like I do but I also saw enough to know this isn't just happening to me. If you want to gamble go ahead but be warned. Wait for a patch for sure.UPDATE: Found a solution. So if your Windows language is not EN or CN and if your alphabet contains the letters ""ö,ü,ğ,ş"" (I don't know which one of these letters cause the problem. Can be one can be all of them at once) the boss AI just gives up for some reason. So the solution is to change your windows language to EN.

Pliny The Welder,62.4,"August 24, 2024",179,"I simply do not understand how this game is overwhelmingly positive.

The game is positively littered with invisible walls which makes exploring a tedious mess.  Running down a path only to find that THIS one ends in an invisible wall while THAT one allows you to continue walking is shockingly awful.Levels are massive open spaces with a tiny smattering of enemies.

It is a shame that the current state of the game includes a major design flaw that ruins an otherwise stellar experience.  It is one that is .In the interest of fairness to the parts of the Wukong development team that actually did a great job, the following aspects of the game are deserving of its currently  review status:However, the one team that absolutely did not live up to the level of quality that their peers delivered is the Level Design team.  The killing blow to the experience for this game is the .  This game should have never been released with this level of lazy implementation of Player Boundary Design.  It is utterly inexcusable to price your game at the AAA level when it is clear that there was less effort put into player boundary design and QA testing than a Nintendo 64 release.Navigating through levels in this game feels like  where you never know if you are going to smash your face on the the glass a few feet where a wall or drop in elevation appears to be or if said change in elevation is actually a path of progression.  The ever-present level of inconsistency with visual indicators of game boundaries and the actual enforced game boundaries makes level navigation and exploration tedious at best.  I do not find it fun to brush up against or jump at everything that looks like a boundary in order to determine if it actually is.  This lack of visual consistency is a big letdown as many of the secret paths contain very useful rewards but the sheer tedium of brute-force invisible wall testing is exhausting to the point where I no longer want to play.  The final insult thrust upon me by the Level Design team was in the 3rd chapter where . . .  If this ever gets fixed I will change my review, and if on the infinitely unlikely chance that the Wukong Game Director reads this review -- allow me to pose a hypothetical question for you:  ""If you went to a 5 Star Steakhouse and ordered their most expensive steak.  You receive the meal and it looks and smells wonderful but you find that you can not cut off a piece from the side.  The Chef tells you that the outer 1/3 of the steak is inedible but you can cut from the middle.  You take a cut from the middle and it tastes well above your expectations.  The second cut from the middle also tastes just as good if not better, but on your 3rd bite you taste nothing at all.  The Chef then explains that 1/3 of the inner portion is inadvertently devoid of taste""What kind of review would you leave for that Restaurant?As a few people have noticed, my gametime is increasing even though I stated above that I would no longer play the game.  In reality I am working on a mod which requires having the game executable open in order to inspect and query game assets.  I anticipate I am no more than a few weeks away from having that released and will post to NexusMods when it is ready.However, I am willing to make an implied agreement with this game studio -- whether they ever end up seeing this or not:Both you and I know how poorly the Level Bounds execution is in this game, I have seen it and you are intimately familiar with it.  Your UE  look fine and are only marginally overextended compared to the elevations that define them.  On the other hand . . . the  and vector defined  are atrocious.  It is almost as if there were two separate teams responsible for those.  Your bounds often coverup areas that themselves have appropriate mesh collision which begs the question of why they were added in the first place.Now it is time for the DEAL. . . If you beat me in releasing an update that addresses the substandard boundary implementation elements . . . not only will I change my review to positive, but I will also not release my mod or any videos which may expose the embarrassing level of quality on display in your boundary design.  I say this knowing full well that the audience I would reach would be miniscule.  but you never know, it may end up reaching someone who actually does have an audience and they may run with it.So I have finished the initial version of the mod and now I can start playing without being distracted by Invisible Walls.

Snobby Hobo,1.1,"August 20, 2024",146,"This is the first title where I actually, genuinely feel deceived by the few reviews I watched. ""It's not inspired by the soulsbornes, it's their own thing"" was uniformly propagated. Well guess what - it's another soulsborne game with some minor twists to the formula I will get into.I deliberately bought this game to finally get some reprieve from the excessive influence Fromsoft has had on the last decade of games and it's just more of the same. The challenge lies entirely in the game obfuscating what to do.  Normal enemies are a minor nuisance, bosses are the focal point. Bosses perform devastating attacks that you need to internalize - and without having seen them performed prior you either get away with a crude, unrewarding feeling victory, or you need to repeat the same thing a few times over. I've stated before I don't like this concept. I don't like games that feel they don't need to communicate their intent. I already played all Souls games there are. I did not buy into this thinking it was just more of the same.The combat model itself is, I suppose, a play on the existing model. Rather than stance breaking a la Sekiro, you generate Focus points by attacking (or charging). Focus points can be leveraged in a multitude of ways that allow you to take some initiative and deal big damage. You don't feel anywhere near as helpless as your average souls game - you intermittently decide the pace of the fight.

It's a boss rush game through and through, and the combat isn't remotely good enough to carry it. The bosses are just tedious endurance tests, with horrible hit-boxes and win conditions. The game emphasizes dodging, and then rewards you with really bizarre hitboxes because the enemies have invisible walls around their body which means you can't be underneath them, which mean your attacks constantly whiff, and bosses can hop a metre away and completely avoid your heavy attacks, which are your win condition.Banging your head against Consort Radahn was frustrating, but fun still because you could feel your progress and know you failed because you messed up.

It has some issues.- The difficultyIf you're looking for a chill action RPG, this game is not for you. The first chapter of the game is relativily mild, but starting with the second chapter the difficulty ramps up CONSIDERABLY. You'll be dying a lot on bosses, run against them over and over again.Aside from being quite hard, the game has a few flaws which made me quit it for now.- The invisible walls everywhere. This destroys any kind of immersion.- The linear gameplay with almost no exploration of any kind.- The missing map - I constantly feel lost. Having no map serves no purpose other than being a nuisance.- The performance is okay, but given that it doesn't look that great nor special, it's a bit poor. It's playable with DLSS and especially with frame gen, but that shouldn't be required to run a game. The optimization is poor. At least it doesn't stutter.If you're looking for an action RPG with a very high difficulty (you cannot change this), almost on Sekiro levels, then this game is for. If not, better skip this.",False,
LeJon,48.9,"September 22, 2024",75,"Your enjoyment of this game heavily relies on your knowledge of the source material or tolerance for soulslike games. I meet neither requirement so for a majority of the 50h I played, I did not have a good time. I was expecting a retelling of the Journey in game format, instead it's an OC sequel to a novel I never read and doesn't even progress the story all that much beyond what is already known.Story wise you meet and fight back to back bosses nearly constantly with no context as to why they want you dead and they don't even say anything besides ""En garde!"" before assaulting you.Gameplay is decent enough to keep you engaged throughout but again the boss rush will sour your playthrough as many of these bosses heavily rely on cheap gimmicks to trip you up during fights like delayed attacks, phase changes where they float in the air for almost a full minute or grabs that instantly shreds half of your HP.The worst offender was Chapter 3, being the longest and a genuine chore to get through as it was the length of both previous chapters combined in total and the final boss had two phase transitions that are cutscenes where you take unavoidable half HP damage and a gold form where he's immune to your basic attacks. While fighting him and searching for tips online I also found out that every boss can input read you charging up for a heavy attack and will back away or dash into you when you start doing so.. Absolutely horrendous and unfair design imo but little irritating tricks like these exist in all of the others to artificially inflate difficulty and force you to die again and again until you ""get good"" like the average soulslike masochist would say.I forced myself to the end waiting to see how long it takes to get good and to my surprise it did, near the end. The secret final boss as well as the final boss himself were beautifully crafted and fairly challenging without relying on the previous gimmicks other bosses would pull. Unfortunately this came at around 40h in my playthrough.In the end I do regret getting roped into the hype train and paying full price for this. I think I'd have been happier with a 30€ price tag a couple months down the line. This is not the end all be all of gaming some people are acting like it is. It just happens to be a decent 7/10 game not plagued by the usual forced agendas we're tired of hearing about.As stated in the beginning, you can disregard this review if you read and enjoy the novel and are a fan of Soulslikes because this absolutely is one despite people trying to trick newcomers into believing it's not.",False,
superkatten,3.1,"August 20, 2024",74,"its terrrible. At least if you like gameplay over visuals. Here are some of the things that makes it a low tier DS clone:Game is mostly a boss rush but fighting the bosses arent fun. very little downtime between bosses. Mostly just spam dodge since they have very bad tells and 0-frame attacks.the combat is floaty where dodges arent the same. 1. is good, second is okay i think and then the 3rd have a delay between getting to dodge again.It has both immortal weapons from nioh and an immobalize spell you can use on bosses, so most of the time you are just waiting for that to come back online. You have light and heavy attacks but some light attacks take muuuch longer to finish so you have to try and just use light attack 2 time and then dodge to reset combo. Also at a boss that has an ability that hits a bigger area than the visual indicate and can go invulvuable and if in a bad part of the arena attacks faster than intended so you cant even dodge spam to avoid dmg.furthermore took an ability that should let me negate incomming dmg if i heavy strike combo but that dosent seem to work.Many of the bosses also have that elden ring boss design where they stop mid swing and then hit with all the momentum as if they dident stop.Camera tracking is ♥♥♥♥, a lot of the time the boss is only half visible on the side of the screen after dodging attack past thenso with all these tings i would consider bad. there isent anything good except its mytholigy and boss visuals that are new.",False,

I love the story, especially how the studio did not try to modify or add any modern crap.Maybe it's only me, maybe I suck, but after 60 h in game, with every new boss my feeling is 'not this again'.I love all NIOH games. Spend over 1000 h playing NIOH on the highest levels. Every new spell, every new skill felt powerful. Every combo was exact and I felt always in control of all my moves. Not in this game.The negative part is related to game play and design decisions- After 55 hours into play, i learned, that certain combos are not possible with my X-box controller setup. Hat to switch to another setup and relearn everything. Try to hold Y, at the same time press X to execute perfect dodge, good luck with that. Miss the full controller configuration capability of Dragon Dogma 2.- Overall bad progress balancing. After playing for many hours you should get a feeling of being rewarded for all the struggle. A feeling of becoming more powerful and stay ahead of most potent enemies. Not in this game. You are always struggling and the rewards feel useless. Even after fighting for 1 - 2 hours and killing a difficult boss, I don't get satisfaction out of it.- In the combat, your combos only work if your exactly match your actions with those of your enemy. If you miss, your combo break and  you are f*cked. - Missing map, not linear game play. You miss a place on the map, you my miss an essential trader of item.

This is a problem that's been solved for decades now. I know it's their first game, but I'm sure it's not the first game they've played. How they could test this and just think it was okay as is, is absurd to me. When I see a 96% review score on Steam, this is NOT what I'm expecting to play. Goes to show just how much bias reviews can have especially when it's it's a huge region of people who've really been wanting a break out success game. And the game still is pretty decent, but I personally wouldn't put it anywhere near the 96% score it's got on Steam. It's a solid 6-7.And if you have a lower end GPU the score drops even further. First 2 chapters won't be much of an issue but upon hitting the 3rd, the already shakey FPS drops further. The problem isn't even the FPS because at times it can be great, it's the timing. Whenever it's having issues it stutters along and makes the overall movement feel terrible. I won't be refunding it YET, until I see what the first patch will look like.

silver_bullet,58.8,"August 21, 2024",59,"I can appreciate the developers effort on this title and constraining the scope to ensure they focus on their strengths i.e. simplify game world design - keeping it linear - and retaining the focus on combat experience (bosses).However, in truth, this is a ""AA title"" with higher fidelity graphics than is typical of the format.I am truly disappointed in the execution in terms of the combat mechanics however ambitious. There are systemic issues in combat system not being responsive enough i.e. input delays, hit boxes not registering etc.These issues amidst ambitious and aggressive combat become severely frustrating especially in critical moments - which can change the tide of battle - which undermine the players efforts; and especially when you progress further into the game and challenges ramp up in difficulty which then require the needed precision.In terms of the game play experience I would recommend holding off on buying this right now and rather wait until these issues are addressed, if at all.I will conclude this review in saying, I completed the game and the game play experience is truly subpar for this genre.NOTE: As I could not refund I insisted on pushing through and completing the game however the experience plays out as described above.

Kylix,56.0,"August 29, 2024",58,"I guess this is a hot take, so bring on the clown awards, but in my opinion, Black Myth Wukong does not live up to the hype. It's absolutely lacking in so many ways I couldn't believe what I was playing based on the reviews I read and I'm sorry if that steps on the toes of your new favorite game, but it's true. I was in no way compelled to continue playing this after the first session and here's why:For starters, the game's performance is unstable at best, even on my 3080ti, i9 CPU, 32GB RAM, liquid cooled machine. It constantly and unexpectedly dipped down to laughably low frame rates to the point that I thought the game was being ran by Microsoft Power Point, even with most of the settings on low and medium, RTX off, DLSS set to performance and frames capped at 120. Unacceptable.Looking past that, the world traversal is some of the most boring gaming I've done in decades. There is nothing to do other than fight a handful of trash mobs, find some meditation spots and then fight bosses. And I mean like every 10ft, there's a new boss. I never even understand why I'm fighting them half the time and they're super forgettable. The title should really be ""Wukong: Boss Rush"" or something more accurate like that. I learn the fights just long enough to beat them and then I never think about them again after they're over.And the game's scenery is so ridiculously bland that everything looks the same to me. There are no useful land marks and no map/minimap, so you're constantly getting lost and back tracking in circles. On top of that, they do absolutely nothing to make you 'feel' like a monkey God while running around. You have a basic sprint and that's it. No cool flips. No world interaction. No wall runs. No climbing. No swinging. No staff tricks. Not even a double jump... It is painfully boring to run around in this game and OMG the amount of invisible walls and dead ends that should be explorable is infuriating.The core gameplay loop is:1. sluggishly traverse through an uninteresting area2. kill trash mobs until you stumble across a boss3. spend an hour learning its gimmicky move set4. finally beat it and repeat, that's itThis game is just way too shallow and bland right now. I got bored in the first sitting and I have no will to even finish it. I will admit though, that the bosses are beautifully crafted and have very imaginative designs that ultimately don't matter because they all seem to have the same basic concept: Rush-down AI, spam attacks, then reset every so often. It felt like I was fighting the same boss reskinned over and over and over, even after 7 hours of play time. Not to mention that some fights are literally just ripped from other games with almost zero changes, like Ornstein and Smough for example.Moving on from that, the game's main draw (the combat) is extremely hollow. There is no block system. No parry system. No backstab system. No stealth system. You literally have a dodge and a stick. The rest comes from a handful of spells, stances and transformations (which are also inconsistent, like, why can't I even JUMP while I'm transformed???) The dodge windows feel awful. Enemies will stun lock you constantly. Tons of CC. Input scanning. Animation locks. Overpowered status effects like poison and fire. Spongy enemies with inflated health pools. Bosses become impervious to your attacks, but they can still hit you. Every cheesy trick in the book to create artificial difficulty and prolonged encounters. It is more frustrating than rewarding and when you finally beat something, you won't feel accomplished, you'll just be happy you got lucky enough to beat the enemy's gimmick one time after hours of failure with nothing to look forward to except doing it all over again in about 10ft.Wukong, to me, is desperately trying to be a mash-up of Dark Souls and God of War, but it fails on both counts. I think the potential is there, but it still needs a while to cook before it gets to the level that these botted reviews would have you believe it's at. Make the areas/maps more interesting and less linear (a true open world would be even better). Bring these beautiful characters to the forefront and really lean into the story. Make the boss mechanics feel more unique in each fight. Improve the traversal. Optimize the performance. Fix these issues and the game's underlying potential will start to shine through.It does some things well, like character designs, musical scores, graphics and beautifully cinematic moments, but it falls flat in so many other ways that I genuinely can't recommend this game in its current state. I really wish I hadn't purchased it yet, as it might be worth playing sometime late next year or in 2026. If not, maybe the inevitable Wukong 2 will hit the mark in ways this one couldn't, but as it stands, this ain't it for me. I would refund if I could.-----Edit: For anyone who might be wondering why my playtime keeps going up after a review like this, it's quite frankly because I paid $60 for the game and I don't want that money to go to waste, so I'm going to finish it.

♿Beverage,50.9,"August 21, 2024",55,"The game runs bad even on high end PCs. I get solid FPS with a 3090 and i12900k but at the cost of visual clarity. It looks unplayable on console. They haven't optimized it, they have covered up the poor performance and quality with adaptive resolutions and extremely intense motion blur. If you are not playing the game yourself this isn't as noticeable, but if you play with motion blur off or on you'll quickly realise how bad the game looks. In the first cutscene, everything is extremely grainy. When you transform and scout the mountain, that is not a developer choice to limit your vision. It's literally the game trying to hide how terrible it looks when there is many assets on screen with motion blur. The adaptive scaling being necessary means that even if you have solid FPS, timings on dodges will still change slightly. It's extremely noticeable when you get input delay if you are going for perfect dodges. I think people are over hyped for this game, especially when it comes to the visuals. They look great on stream watching someone else play, but terrible when you play yourself.If you're not already set on this game, you are better off saving your money until you find out if they'll actually try to optimize it, instead of giving us worse resolutions and farting in our eyes with motion blur in an AAA title.",False,

Dastardly Dragon,61.3,"November 10, 2024",51,"After waiting for this game since it's teaser trailer, and now finally completing the game (and most side quests), I am ready give my opinion on it.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game.BMW is a difficult boss rush game with a fantastic story and minor RPG elements. Many people have already brought up the minor points of the game so I am gong straight to the main point. The combat is pretty much the whole of the game, going from boss to boss with minor fights in-between. The fights are incredibly punishing but feel so because the bosses are artificially difficult. I can only explain it through an example: After encountering a boss and dying multiple times you learn the bosses move sets and are able to dodge their moves and time your attacks. However, even after you do so, you realize that the boss still has 2/3rds of their health left and you have to battle perfectly...5 MORE TIMES. It really becomes a test of endurance rather than skill or reflexes. This becomes even more apparent after you utilize all of your spells and skills and are now left to slog through the battle with two incredibly repetitive moves (light and heavy attack). I found myself fairly bored with many battles, despite still dying repeatedly, because the enemies just last way too long because of their artificially inflated health bars. I have never played dark souls so I cannot compare it to BMW. To compare it to other games it feels like any other action adventure game just played on the highest difficulty. And that's the biggest problem I have with this game: why would it have been so hard to put in a difficulty option and simply reduce or increase the bosses health for each level you choose?The lack of difficulty options bothers me so much because it just makes me think of all of the people who gave up on this game, never even tried it, or just sped through it and missed so much side content and deep lore. Because that is where this game shines: the story is the reason I pushed through to the end. It is a ""sequel"", of sorts, to Journey to the West. The love the devs have of the source material is apparent in the beautifully crafted world, uniquely designed enemies and characters, and, most important, the masterfully told stories in the journal entries. Seriously, if you play this game: read the journal entries! They could be sold as a book on their own. If you really want to understand the story you must read the journal entries.With so much love put into the story you would think they want people to experience it. Instead the artificially difficult bosses and slightly boring combat blocks many people from fully enjoying it or even being able to see it in the first place.I understand this game is meant to be difficult but it still baffles me that the devs put so much into a story that so many people will not see or fully appreciate. It is because of this that I cannot recommend Black Myth: Wukong until a difficulty option is implemented (which will never happen). I'm sure most responses to this review will simply be: ""git gud""",False,
Akihito Tsukushi,58.8,"August 24, 2024",50,"Для начало видео обзор Стрим про обезьянку How annoying modern gaming is, this *****, there is no map in this game, such trash, you run around like a fool in the location and don't understand where to go. And if you come across several paths, you will get completely lost, there is only one weapon, a stick, the developers couldn't come up with more, even in the trashy Naraka, there are so many different weaponsI am a relatively one-sided player. I am a pure combat player. The following content is extremely subjective, so I want to say that in addition to the art, plot, and images of the movie god, which either surprise me or scare me a little, the gameplay. looks like the same as fw.Each boss design is better than the last, and there are several outstanding features. Weird perspective, super long NC boss combo, 360 degree tracking knife with no blind spots, it can be a big AOE, and there are others. bosses that are sometimes impossible to hit even in the face, all sorts of completely illogical things on shields. Brother Monkey's performance is even more funny. The rolling feeling is like a stick. The doctor needs to take a lead move, but the second move is to exchange blood to exit. What kind of genius can come up with such a high risk and low return? Can this even be called a punishment? There are also NC adjustments for various moves that are so weak that hitting an ADHD boss is ridiculously difficult. My performance is even lower than that of a horse build. I become hard when touched by various monsters, which interrupts the last part of my light stick or splits my heavy stick. The heavy stick also requires brains. In order to strengthen the use of a heavy stick, it is understandable that you will have to exchange blood, but the hegemony of your heavy stick is sometimes lacking. Even if the blood is exchanged, why is the opponent's blood not lost? Combined with the weak adjustment mentioned above, even if I get a stick, there is a small chance that I will not be able to hit. When I reach the full three-stage stick position, I still can't hit. a kind of beauty of empty accumulation that makes your blood pressure soar. The connection between the three stick techniques is extremely weak, and useless moves arise endlessly. Not to mention the light and weak impact. Two of the three main participants in the neighborhood were creating sticks. If you count the subsequent works of a certain person, including sticks and guns, how could they create such a bad sound effect and weaken the impact. Transforming into a monster is still a lot of FW transformations, calling a certain move, and shaking the horse, which lasts longer than its own life. Of course, I want to say that all this is not ""designed for amateurs"" as some say. It is true that the action system is complex and some people may not understand it at all, and a simple game with. a good battle system will bring more fun to players. A good combat experience like Sekiro and Youmonkey is the type of person who wants to make it easy for beginners to get started, but at the same time make the combat experience extremely poor. You may have come up with a lot of solutions, but I would say that most of them add up the values, add poison damage to the attack, and fight defense. What about the actual battle? This is what I said above.If someone says this thing is good for combat, my opinion is to eat it. Of course, if you still feel good after eating, then I will obey you. I was worried about his movements when the battle planning in this game was launched, but I didn’t expect it to be so bad. Oh also said to Yang Qi: “Battle planning is the core position of our project. Almost all planning teachers are battle planners. Some are also level planners, some are protagonists, literature, systems, etc.” What is so bad about him? Combined with art, he looks like a beautiful piece inlaid with gold.",False,
gentle todd,27.9,"September 1, 2024",48,"I really wanted to like this game, but it falls victim to many poor design decisions and I found the game far more tedious and frustrating than it should be.First off, the game is gorgeous, the cutscenes are fun, and I'm sure the story is great, though I struggled to follow along since I'm not familiar with JTTW. The game ran almost flawlessly on my machine as well.But I found the combat too simple, the customization and skill trees are shallow, and overall the whole game was pretty repetitive. 25 hours of doing the same light attack spam, followed by a heavy attack, got tiring quickly. Games centered entirely around the combat need some more variation to keep it interesting.Level design is bland, the fodder/non-boss enemies are often too easy and there's so much running in this game, the levels are huge, exploration felt slow and tedious.The bosses are the best part of the game, I found myself bored in the sections between bosses and just couldn't wait to get to the next one.But then the bosses start getting really rough at the end of chapter 4 and beyond. There is a lot of artificial difficulty that can turn such a cool spectacle of a fight to something you just want to be over because it's really just that unfun. Like a boss will remove 70% of your stamina bar, or make your dodges slower, or put 6 aoe tornadoes that just follow you around half of the fight that nuke your health bar etc. Some fights have some major hitbox issues too. Also boss HP is too high in the late game, fights drag on and on.80 tries to beat an Elden Ring boss was far more fun than 20-30 tries to beat one of the stinkier fights later in this game.Other games of this genre set the bar very high, and this game fell a bit below for my taste.",False,
DecentHobo,10.2,"August 21, 2024",48,"I'm just going to type about the game because I am not a game reviewer, nor do I have expertise on Game Development. However, I've played video games consistently since the early 2000's. This game is good looking. The cinematic elements of the game are a nice touch but it doesn't make up for the fact that the fighting mechanics are not done well. The common enemies are eliminated by button mashing. While the elite enemies tend to have heavy attacks that you dodge once and then spam mash light attack until their HP is gone. This is early game that I'm talking about so it might be possible to have other abilities later on. This review has come to be after I fought the second boss (The water snake noble guy) and can't beat him. Is it because I don't want to be patient? Absolutely I don't want to be patient! But his attacks (I felt the same way about the first boss) are too difficult to read, and I spend my time spam dodging until he's done. I've played and beaten both Dark Souls 3 and Elden Ring (DLC Included) and this game is just mechanically clunky. The fights just feel like you take turns attacking. There is not a defensive strategy early on. I can't block (except archers' arrows but I've only run into 2 of them), I can't parry, and I can't counter.The game looks good, feels ok, but overall the fighting aspect (at least early on) is mechanically impossible to actually feel like a Martial Arts Monkey. I think my only issues is how narrow and closed in the beginning feels. I get that there isn't an open world aspect and that it is very linear. Which in games like Sekiro are fine because it felt like there was some level of exploration. This game locks you into a path that says ""Get good"" but cares more about creating a challenging Fromsoft experience without the vast equipment or abilities that Fromsoft gifts to their players with their choices of character creation. Again, not a game reviewer, just a frustrated gamer that spent $60 on another game that doesn't feel fine tuned. (just feels like with all the open world games nowadays, companies don't know how to create efficient linear maps).I am not returning this and do plan on trying to beat it, but not because I love the video game, but because I love video games.  I could recommend this game for certain types of players, just not ones like me.",False,
Hexatomb,6.7,"August 20, 2024",48,"Another game my dumb, old gamer self can't play because it's woefully unforgiving. Why can't games be fun anymore? Why can't games just have a casual and fun mode?The graphics are nice and the overall visuals and enemy design are well done. You can jump but there's invisible walls everywhere with no indication of when or where you can't go someplace. It staggers your character and really ruins the experience of a beautiful landscape. Want to explore over there? Nope, wall. 3 feet to the left though, there's an open path. It's very disorienting and linear.The combat feels jerky and there's a lack of polish between moves. This game is all about dodging but half the time I can't dodge because animations wont cancel or I'm having to worry about an unnecessary stamina bar.

Wade,97.5,"August 19, 2024",47,"Not Recommended""Black Myth: Wukong"" has stunning graphics, but my experience was disappointing for these reasons:1. Over-Hyped: The game is ambitious but doesn't live up to the hype. The gameplay is underwhelming compared to the visuals.2. Controller Issues: If you use a DualSense controller, be ready for frustration. The game doesn't recognize it unless you use Steam’s input passthrough, which is a hassle.3. Limited Controller Options: There's no customizable key mapping for controllers—just two preset modes. This limits your ability to adjust controls to your liking.4. Cringey Dubbing: The dubbing is terrible and breaks immersion, making the experience less enjoyable.5. Performance Problems: Despite having a gaming desktop, the game runs poorly. Frequent frame drops and stuttering are common.6. No HDR Support: For a game with such a focus on visuals, the lack of HDR support is disappointing, especially in 2024.In short, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a missed opportunity.

It's just mini-bosses with hardly any mobs between them, leaving most of the game play being boss fights that you die over and over to until you figure out their moves.

Nightserg,41.7,"September 14, 2024",42,"Do be aware that the majority of the reviews for Wukong are from China, even those in English, and as such this review will probably trigger some. We live in a time where singleplayer games without any kind of bs such as pandering to the far left, microtransactions, and similar trash are rare, so rare that whenever a pure singleplayer game with a pretty hefty budget focuses on the right things releases, gamers will instantly love it and ignore all its faults. Black Myth Wukong is one of those games. I am not one of those gamers. Black Myth Wukong is an extremely average action-adventure game that heavily takes inspiration from games of its genre while not excelling at anything in particular. 👍 +Certain boss fights are pretty well-designed👎-One of the worst level designs I've ever encountered-Outside of boss fights, there is nothing good-Incredibly boring atmosphereThe story is based on Journey to the West which is a very famous fictional novel in China. It's sadly not a very direct story, similar to God of War, but instead, they decided to go the obtuse route which makes it even worse as the novel itself was already incredibly difficult to follow. Black Myth Wukong's story is more of a giant proverb that heavily focuses on the metaphorical morality of life which felt at odds with itself because, at certain times, it feels like it wanted to be a normal story, similar to God of War or any western media, but then decides to forget it and it starts going into nonstop proverbial dialogues irrelevant to the main story, if we can even call it a story. This is more evident as each chapter has unique cinematics, which were very cool designed, that have a moral at the end, for example, there was this story where a guy finds a wounded fox in the mountains, takes it home to take care of it, it transforms into a beautiful woman and their life begins, however at the end, the woman was actually a demon and she devours his family, but then he wakes up back at the cabin. Realizing the dream was a sign, he kills the fox. These small cinematics were great and the game would've benefited more if they relied on them throughout the chapters, for example being part of the guy's story and the final boss would be the fox demon. Sadly as it is, the story was just average, you have to collect artifacts to become the chosen one, the end. Perhaps for people living in China, it might be more nostalgic than anything else. Story rating: 6.5/10Wukong's gameplay isn't exactly fresh or new and sadly it didn't do anything good or fun up until the end. It copies core mechanics from God of War, Jedi Survivor, and From Software games and mixes them, a jack of all trades master of none. You spam attacks at bosses with tons of health, dodge a few times and that is it. Out of the ""hundreds"" of bosses it has, I can count on one hand the ones that may have required some thinking or learning their attack patterns. A lot of people were dismissive of calling the game a boss rush, however, they are factually wrong because for starters, outside of boss fights, there is absolutely nothing good about the gameplay. The smaller enemies are some of the most boring and uninteresting-designed enemies you've ever faced and are just there to pad the game for no reason. The looting and finding things aspect is average, as most of the good stuff drops from bosses. Sadly since each boss has more and more HP, you're forced to explore and look for mats to increase your damage output else you'll be spending an hour taking down their health. I've never felt a sense of awe or ""wow look at this epic thing I found"" once in the entire game, though I have to give them credit for turning a simple game into a weak RPG as an afterthought. Yes, the game has skill points as you'd expect, and yes most of them are useless.Moving on from the mid aspects of the game, the boss fights is what most people are in for. I say boss fights, but I consider them the average enemy in this game and only a few are actual boss fights. These boss fights are average towards ok. You'll never face anything as terrifying as the likes of Souls games or as amazingly cinematic as the likes of God of War games. To make matters worse, they're all HP sponges, and outside of using a few skills and dodging you're just hitting a wall with your stick. Gameplay rating: 7/10Overall the audio design is decent, I played it with Chinese voice acting and I had no problems with it at all, they all performed quite well. The soundtrack is pretty good, nothing really memorable, but it does a decent job of making the boss fights less boring. As for the rest of the sound effects, nothing really good or bad to say about them. I never felt the environments being alive which would be a minus, but then again, I have a lot of negative things to say about the atmosphere of the game below. Audio rating: 7.5/10The game uses Unreal Engine 5 and as such expect horrible performance if you don't use DLSS or frame generation, expect heavy stutters when the game loads new assets such as boss skills. The worst offenders are the atmosphere and level design. For starters, the game as I mentioned is based on a fantastic fictional novel Journey to the West. If you've seen movies based on it, you might remember some very nice locations and architectural designs. The game has none of that. Instead, you'll be exploring forests and caves that you've seen a million times or outside of your house with a few Buddhist statues and temples copy-pasted for lore reasons. I'm not even joking, watch a walkthrough, that's all you'll ever be in, forests, whether it's dead ones, lush ones, or snowy ones. The second worst offender is the level design. It makes absolutely no sense. If you've played any Dark Souls game you'll know each road you take is masterfully inter-connected to one another, the whole map is a giant playground. Wukong has its main zones split by loadings so they're not connected to one or the other. Furthermore, each zone has multiple paths that lead to nowhere or minibosses making exploration incredibly tedious. The last offender is the input, specifically the reading of it. It's incredibly delayed, certain skills take forever for Wukong to use, for example, you'll have to spam drinks in order for him to actually start drinking them and the same goes for the skills. To make matters worse, certain skills take forever to cast and enemies just attack non-stop which will cancel your skills and put them on cooldown. Sometimes they bugged. It's a mess. Most people will look at the game and say ""Wow look at those graphics, look at those tree leaves flying around you"" and that's all just generic UE5 assets. Everything about the environments felt soulless, like someone generated using ""AI"". Compared to Dark Souls, a game that came out decades ago which on a technical level wasn't that great, Wukong looks incredibly uninspired and would've benefited more if they focused on art rather than pretty trees. Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 5/10I don't think anyones going to even notice this review, since 90% of the reviews are just blindly praising the game and ignoring its faults, but I advise against purchasing it at full price.",False,
Woolyruthless,35.1,"September 10, 2024",42,"This game is severely over-hyped. The graphics, music, and cut scenes are awesome. The fundamental aspects of this game revolving around combat have a lot QoL issues that make this impossible for me to want to keep playing. See below for examples:Healing potion doesn't always work, spamming often uses more than intended. I have tested this outside of combat as well. I have NO idea how more people have not brought this up. It's infuriating. Immobilize (Freeze ability) just bugs out randomly, cool down is started as if you used it. Often times during a boss you need to cast this spell quickly to give some relief in the pace of combat. Several times this spell has cast, done nothing, and the cool down starts to countdown as if I have used it.Issues with ""Composure skill"" - this ability allows you to dodge attacks in the middle of light combo attacks. It doesn't always work. Other issues: - The spawn location when you die and reattempt Zhu Baije boss is such a baffling bad design, I can't believe the devs thought it was a good idea to make you walk for 3 minutes every time you respawn and reattempt that boss, JFC. - chapter 3 straight up sucks, you're stuck going in a circular prison for 2 hours.  - Scorpion mini boss Chapter 4 - severely bugged. Multiple times wasn't able to attack because boss was glitched in strange position. - One of the coolest looking areas in the game, Purple Cloud Mountain, has awful screen tearing. Had no issues in the other areas of the game. Really takes away from the enjoyment of this awesome looking area.",False,
Langlex,72.7,"August 24, 2024",42,"Don't trust the benchmark, be it the tool or the in-game one if you have a weak pc, the game suffers significant framedrops and stutters starting with the final boss of the first level, which could make you overdue for a refund.------------------Update after nearly another 20 hours:After got kicked back by steam refund policy, I found more means to improve performance and beat the first two levels, I must say I'm deeply impressed with the artworks of this game, true works of art. The stutters, clearly centered upon various effects, are said to be a nasty quirk of early UE5 engine after some discussion. I faced them again with the white dragon on chapter 3, this time even heavier when it starts casting lightnings.However its not unmanageable as long as you use spells to lock it out of using them, and the rolls in this game have a very long range and much more invincible frames even compared to Dark Souls 3, so its okay.Still I'll leave this here as negative as a fare warning. Performance on low-end pc only becomes acceptable with a lot of downgrading to real resolution and frame generation that comes with the algorithm to fake it, pixelating effects and everything in motions, which is everywhere in a fast paced arpg, so much that it often hurts the eyes, evident with the floating sands on chapter 2.

Toasterstrud311,5.3,"August 20, 2024",38,"I honestly don't know if i can recommend this game to anyone except die hard fans of the original story. Sadly the only thing positive i can say about the game is that it is BREATHTAKING to look at, good GOD they did such a good job with it. Other than that I have many problems with the game.Let's start with the biggest sin of the game imo the story (or lack there of). As someone who has not read the journey to the west story and only has a very basic knowledge of the story i am so confused as to what is going on. I'm half way through chapter 2 and the only thing i can say about the story is that I am a monkey and i have bonked many things because the game said so. It seems like the developers just expect everyone to have read the story and understand whats going on.Next sin the combat. First i'd like to say that the actual combat feels great, nothing groundbreaking but fun. My biggest issue is the amount of bosses and the miniscual amount of damage you do to them. In the first chapter you fight 5 or 6 bosses, most of them happen one right after another. Even when i upgraded my weapons I tickled most of the bosses i fought while they took out a quarter of my health with one hit. This game obviously takes inspiration from god of war and jedi survivors however the one thing they didn't incorporate from those games is a difficulty option. If they wanted to make it more of a souls like game, they should've allowed for greater weapon customization to compensate for the minuscule amount of damage your base weapon does. Instead they give you a stick and expect you to just keep bonking the bosses until they stop moving. While I do acknowledge this can be fun for some people, I found it infuriating. Another big issue with some of the fights is the camera, at the end of chapter 1 you fight a random bear dude who loves to dash from one end of the arena to the other. While on paper this sounds fun, in execution the camera constantly jumping everywhere makes it hard to read the bosses movements and dodge accordingly. Another aspect of the combat that infuriates me is the skills. While yes the skills your given are really cool, they aren't as big of a help as you would think. Take for instance the freeze skill. Every time i used it, it was a guessing game for how long it would last. Sometimes it would last for 10 seconds and other times it would last for a single second, there were even times it didn't work period. The skills also use your ""mana"" however you are given no way of recovering your mana other than using rest points. So once your mana runs out, these skills which are vital to the gameplay are no longer available to you and you're back to using your stick which does no damage. The last sin I want to talk about is level design. While yes the maps are GORGEOUS and exploration is highly encouraged, the problem lies in the absurd amount of invisible walls throughout some of the maps. Every time i saw what looked like a path i could explore i was stopped by an invisible wall. Exploring parts of the map i was allowed to explore also wasn't that rewarding, I often found myself walking in circles because the path you were supposed to follow wasn't made clear and most of the ""rewards"" you find are either in game currency or another boss which rewards you with a lackluster skill.Overall if you're that desperate for a god of war/jedi survivor type game go ahead and play this. But be warned this game isn't as polished as those games are. If you want to experience the journey to the west story DO NOT play this game, nothing is explained and you'll probably just end up as confused as i am.",False,

Gordon,39.4,"September 5, 2024",35,"I was on the fence about whether to recommend this game or not before I realized that if I need to think about it, then I can’t recommend it. Still,  is about as close to getting a recommendation as a game that I don’t recommend can be, if that’s worth anything. If you can snag this on sale for $30 or $40, it’s worth that price. It’s also important to support games like this and  that show that countries not known for producing solid single-player games can do just that. But there is a limit to what that leeway will allow.  is so close to being such a solid game. Sadly, as I continued playing, I was having less and less fun with it. Maybe my expectations were too high for a developer’s first “real” video game. Maybe I should have expected some of the jank and some of the issues in the game. Then again, for a $60 game that presents itself as being on the same level as other AAA titles, maybe it isn’t completely unfair that my expectations were as high as they were for . The game starts strong with Wukong talking insane amounts of trash to a literally massive Celestial Court. I was all for that. I was ready to be on board with this character. I was ready for a story where he could grow from this brash character across a long journey. Wukong in the intro was so enjoyable that it was a punch in the mouth when we got stuck with a mute monkey that has no personality, character, or charm. Looking back on it, I think the Destined One was probably meant to be a character you project yourself onto. That’s all fine and good, but sadly, I wasn’t a monkey swinging around a staff the last time I checked, so that fell a little flat. That start put me in a disappointed mindset. I can’t help but feel like it would have been better to include that glorified cutscene toward the end of the game instead of leaving the player with a jarring character shift right at the start of the story. In fact, a lot of the other characters are fun to watch, which makes the Destined One’s complete lack of character even more annoying to deal with as the story progresses. I get that writing a character to be the focal point of a long story can be hard, but come on, this was based on one of the most iconic pieces of Chinese literature in the world. Something more than a mute monkey could have been done here. In fact, despite being based on one of the most iconic pieces of Chinese literature ever, the story isn’t up to much at all. I will concede that this might be because I’m entirely unfamiliar with , but I think I can be forgiven for expecting a standalone game to tell a story. The second, third, or fourth game in a series? Sure, it’s on me for not knowing what’s going on. I’m not putting not having a firm grip on the narrative on me in this instance, not when the story dumps come in the form of “music videos” before dropping me in the middle of a brand-new area and biome. Mighty nice-looking biomes, mind you. Granted, they’re the kind of nice-looking that’s better for pretty screenshots instead of practical and intuitive level design. After Chapter 1, the areas are just too big. I felt like I was spending most of my time running around, trying to hunt for secrets since I wanted to get as much out of the game as possible, and that became annoying. Granted, I appreciate a developer who puts huge areas and missable secrets in games that are both cool and help with the future critical path stuff. It makes it worth the player’s time and effort to engage with side content, and in the world of bloated games like  and , having side content that’s worth engaging with is a huge plus.  Still, the level design became almost unbearable in  I know you made very pretty environments. They are very pretty indeed. Please, when you make the inevitable sequel to this game, trim the fat down, make the areas smaller, add better indicators for what’s a pile of rubble that’s worth climbing on and what isn’t, and let people focus on the best part of your game: the combat. The combat, while the best part of the game—particularly against the visually impressive bosses—still has its own set of baggage. There’s a robust set of skill trees, and while there aren’t really “builds” in , there are plenty of options to shake up your play style. There are probably too many skill tree options, but unlike Path of Exile, looking at  skill trees doesn’t make me want to puke. Low bar to clear but clear it  did. The biggest issue with the combat is that it just doesn’t work half the time. I have no idea how they worked on this game for so long, hanging their hat on the combat, and somehow aerial heavy attacks just don’t connect. It was insane how many times I would walk up to a stationary enemy, jump in the air, and use my heavy attack, just for my hit to not connect. This game spent 6 years in development. I should not have issues hitting an aerial heavy attack because the game decided to take a nap on the job. Enemy hitboxes and hurtboxes in general aren’t very good. Too many attacks would miss because an enemy bigger than my apartment wiggled an inch to the left. Of course, that rule doesn’t apply to you. In the interest of fairness, the Destined One decided to expand his hurtbox to twice his normal size on either side of him. The only exception to this is when you’re in your Rock Solid—the game’s parry—form. Then enemy attacks will often conveniently miss you until you’re out of your Rock Solid form. Rock Solid is one of the first spells that just won't work half the time. There’s a bug where you can use your Immobilize spell on a boss, but it won’t work, and the boss will hit you anyway and out your spell on cooldown. I’m giving the developers the benefit of the doubt by saying this is a bug, because if it’s intentional game design to have the immobilize spell not immobilize when used, then it’s inexcusable. Even when the spells do work, there’s a chunk of bosses that just don’t let you use them. You’ll use Immobilize, and what is essentially plot armor kicks in, and they say you don’t get to use that spell. Nope, it doesn’t matter how many points you invested into that spell. You don’t get to use it on the boss because the game says you can’t. On top of that, some of the boss fights are horrendously designed and were the tipping points into making me realize the game just wasn’t as fun as it had been. Despite the game itself getting easier as it went on thanks to the upgrades, the devs made sure to study up on Manus, Father of the Abyss, to make sure they got their spastic flailing down just right. At least the worst single attack most bosses have in their arsenals is the lost mystical art of a random 20 FPS drop. are two boss fights that are exceptionally bad, making sure they stocked up on their  18-hit, flailing combos along with plenty of poise (a trait shared with normal enemies, for some reason) to ensure they got to be as annoying as possible. When they decide you’ve had too much fun and got to play the game too much, they make sure to take to the air for a few years, letting you contemplate your sins of winning too hard. You know what? Perhaps that’s in line with the game’s themes. Disappointingly,  is a game of numerous small irritations that surround the core of something that could be so much better. In a game that can take around 40 hours to complete when doing as much content as possible, numerous small irritations start to mount and pile on to the point that the game is best purchased on sale, or at the very least, when some of those issues get ironed out.",False,

Used Chicken,13.1,"September 2, 2024",34,"Visually incredible but the gameplay is extremely inconsistent. The level design is pretty much a non-factor, the landscapes are beautiful but gameplay wise, they're just settings to whale of lesser yaoguai. Many of said lesser yaoguai are immense damage sponges which means taking them out is more of a chore than I'd prefer. This doesn't make them harder to deal with, mind you, they're almost all trivially easy to stunlock when you get them one on one which is 90%+ of your encounters with them. At its worst the level design devolved into major jank, with thin plans to walk across while trying to deflect arrows, an action which would sometimes just send you falling into the abyss. Many areas looked accessible in the world but upon closer inspection were blocked off by a low rock that the monkey king should be able to jump over with ease. In general the levels' visual layout constantly remind you that you're in a game world. Since you aren't really here for the levels, you'd hope that either the narrative or the bosses would be the real show stoppers. The narrative didn't really do it for me. It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special, even by game standards, and it was marred by what I can only imagine was a mediocre translation. The bosses were more of a mixed bag. All were visually captivating, some were mechanically interesting, and some were horrible. In general the combat is a little too floaty, giving too little visual and auditory feedback on dealing or receiving damage to be truly satisfying. I've seen this game sold as somewhere between a Dark Souls and a God of War on the gameplay style and I can see that, but it lacks the visceral feel of the combat in either series and thus finds itself inferior to both. The worst boss fight I completed before giving up was the dragon in the third area, which constantly floats just high enough that your attacks have maybe a 60% chance of landing. It's not a difficult fight and I cleared it on my second try but it feels more like a fight against janky design than the challenging foe the dragons design should represent. Ultimately the only thing that really impressed me here was the visuals.",False,
Hot Cigar,4.7,"August 31, 2024",34,"After clearing a stage 4.5 hours in I feel like there is a big ""something"" missing from the combat.It's quite disappointing as the rest of the game looks and feels excellent, from the story telling choices and the UI's.But combat being the main aspect of the game I can't really bring myself to play any further than the Electric Frog Boss very early in the second Chapter.I feel like there is no impact when striking my opponents, the peons are very weak and die too quickly to get that satisfying final hit during the combo but it feels like a waste to use a fully charged heavy to quickly dispatch them with that satisfying smack.When fighting a boss I feel like I'm a flea using CQC on an Ox. I'm relying on my cool-downs to rinse and repeat every single time and after a few too many encounters I can feel the repetitive nature scratching away at my brain.I really wanted to like this game as it IS beautiful the illustrations, the effort in the descriptions of the Yaoguai is insane.I don't know if this is me being picky... but the very obvious invisible walls seems a tad lazy for the quality we see in many areas. I feel like this is an example of ""Being a mile wide but an inch deep"" when it comes to their level design. UE5 is beautiful but it isn't a crutch.I know it's not an open world game but I'd like some creativity when it comes to blocking my path.Pros:- Storytelling- Stunning illustrations- Unintrusive UI (for how many mechanics are at play)Cons:- Flat feeling combat- Early repetitive nature",False,
Birthday,45.1,"August 20, 2024",32,"everyone seems to be highlighting its strong suites i'm going to try and highlight some of its negatives. i recommend it but there are way too many positives to filter out some grievancesso far generally speaking though i really like it. i'm only hitting negative so that if you filter that way you can see some proper criticisms but again its worth buying.  Revising this After around 30 Hours and on chapter 5 i'm deleting most of my first review to now really highlight the major issues i've found with the game at this point and i don't imagine will be fleshed out by the end of it. hit detection can be real hit or miss sometimes, especially when you transform it seems like only one part of the staff hits, however enemies auto target, hone in and follow you even in the air or while spinning on the ground. additionally almost every part of an enemy during an attack is part of the attack, even if their back foot doesn't move you'll probably take damage. enemies can be staggered but they have no indicator for this or tells really, telegraphing across the board could use a couple more passes. some enemies will launch the same attack,  identical animations but one will lock you into a cut scene, one will do chip damage one will take a 4th of your health this is especially prevalent on bosses.- This has been a major upset, some enemies have 3-4 Cutscene 75% damage hits that you just cannot avoid. its a way of circumventing difficulty with guarenteed damage and i dont think this is a good design especially used as often as it is. some you can dodge i think? but sometimes i think that the bug is i could dodge it and not the otherway around. Now Do they look cool? yes for sure but again its the amount of them used that i find the issue with and the telegraphing in general can be rough.  Exploration is very lacking to non existent, it gets better in the second chapter i'm not sure about onward but it defiantly is better there, however the invisible walls in this game are insane i've honestly never see a modern use this egregious. for a group that has designed some truly breathtaking and exciting vistas you are constantly blocked by walls. some areas you aren't, even though you'd think you would be. it makes fully exploring or uncovering secrets not that fun cause you are sorta trained to not look because everything blocks you till it doesn't? - so yes the exploration gets much much better later on, especially chapter 4 is gigantic but the issues with walls is present the entire time, and the lack of a map really combines to be problematic. the game is gorgeous without a doubt i've never seen this many art assets used in a game, some gigantic set pieces for just a statue to look at, no context, no journal entry, no boss just a beautiful piece of art. as an artist i love this but from a design standpoint at times it feels like were missing something. This though i think is more a problem with modern game design and not this game specifically. i cant stress enough this probably the first game Over 100gigs where i go ""yeah that makes sense"" it feels like nothing is reused. even down to the shrines, Each zone has its own version, its crazy they really put the work in here. but the Geography of the zones and the lack of a map do make it so that it can just be confusing and frustraiting, i wanna say the game is doing this intentionally to teach a lesson that wukong also is learning, keeping track of the enviroment, looking around, being aware but again some of the parts are just confusing. i don't want any type of Quest marker or direction, just a simple map with shapes would be totally fine. some kind of layout. but truth told if you were in his postion you probably wouldn't have one. last thing ill touch on is itemization i don't love it, i also don't quite get how its delivered. You have 4 slots. helm, gloves, chest and feet. These all have set bonuses that are for either 2,3,4 pieces so mixing is really not optimal in anyway and it seems designed for full sets. some sets designed for just a specific move. ideally this is fine but when theyre delivered is confusing to say the least. The way theyre set out is similar to like monster hunter, say like you killed a poison type monster, well now you have resistance to poison. here its like i killed a boss and he gave me a set that increases certain stats while standing in mud which the boss itself was also in mud. i have not seen mud again or before that fight, so its like a set of armor designed for a specific fight that you just did and realistically may never do again until a new game plus. i think i new game plus run of this game would be fantastic for a number of reasons but the gear feels like its only designed for a second run and not the current, you also dont get a ton of it to where it seems like you have a ton of options i probably have 7 or so sets and maybe a handful of individual pieces at chapter 5. even down to smaller items, i have a curio that gives +exp gained on kills but i didnt find this till lvl 80 in current area, sorta pointless at that point. or a boss gave a set that does poison to you but you heal from it but you are always taking chip damage the next zone it puts you in is all chip fire damage so not really incentivized to use it. it just feels very tacked on for what it could be. its nice to have and feel the upgrades and see the costume changes but it could be done so much better.again i still love the game, i highly recommend it overall but my original thoughts still stand through out the entire game. i originally said its 75%-80% near a perfect game and it is still true. The Art direction though again is so compelling, its just there really hasn't been anything like it on this scale or with this production value and i cant wait to see more from the developer. id be really curious to know the lead time on this game and if the developers are listening Please for the love of god make an art book for the game i would buy it instantly, this is one of the most inspiring parts of the game and it needs to be championed i just want concept art finished art whatever you have i want to see it.",False,

antidotcb,0.7,"August 20, 2024",32,"This game might look sick, but it feels dead inside. The story’s a total snooze fest, and instead of letting you roam free, it keeps you locked on rails. You’re just wandering around with no clear goal, moving from one checkpoint to another without any real motivation. I was hoping for some juicy lore or backstory to sink my teeth into, but nah, it’s just not there.Gameplay? It gets stale fast. Sure, the tutorial tells you the basics—press this for a light attack, that for heavy—but the combat is brain-dead simple. You’re just mashing the same buttons over and over, farming loot, and finding obvious chests and resources. The enemies are dumb as rocks, barely reacting to anything you throw at them. Even the boss fights are a joke; they might stagger, but good luck figuring out when or why. Honestly, it feels like the game was made for kids. I’m just not getting that challenge I crave, and what’s up with having a store in the resting place menu? At least throw in some NPCs to interact with or something.Yeah, the graphics are dope, but the performance is straight-up disappointing. The game doesn’t even support native resolution, relying on DLSS to keep things running. And get this—despite rocking a beastly rig with an i9-13900 and a 4090, the game still struggles to hit 60 fps. It dips to 40, even 30 during fights, all while stuttering like crazy at 4K with max settings and high ray tracing. There’s nothing complex going on to justify these performance issues, which just makes it all the more frustrating.Honestly, after playing something as lit as ""Shadow of the Erd Tree,"" this game just doesn’t cut it. The simple mechanics and easy gameplay don’t scratch that itch anymore. Maybe this game just isn’t my vibe, but I was expecting a lot more. Even with all the eye candy, the lack of depth and the performance hiccups kill the experience for me.",False,

Tenelia,36.0,"August 25, 2024",30,"Definitely DO NOT recommend this.I've grown up on a large variety of games, and this game suffers from bad pacing and design.You need a 4080 to play because I've found the input lag unbearable. From technical reviews like Digital Foundry, you *must* turn off frame generation and other settings (global illum, shadows, anti-aliasing, etc) because these cause significant input delay. Why buy a game costing $94 only to kill visual settings?? Its optimization is shockingly bad when other visually stunning games run well. Warframe, Doom Eternal, Elden Ring, etc are all examples of fast-paced gorgeous games at over 200fps on older systems. Act 1 unfortunately runs past 2 hours so by the time these issues become apparent, I can't get a refund.Key problems:1) Buggy input queues for spirits, transformation, and medicines. Sometimes I must keep tapping the button to trigger usage. Sometimes a light tap interrupts my attack combo instead of queuing up. Sometimes nothing happens after spamming repeatedly and I'm standing around while the boss is waiting in the background weirdly.2) Dodge mechanic very inconsistent. e.g. I've managed to dodge bosses OHKO attack, but after repeated experiments, it's inconsistent. The perfect dodge mechanic also doesn't trigger consistently. It feels like you inconsistently have a larger hitbox.3) Horrifically bad camera angles. Most games have an ""greasy camera slide"" algorithm to detect obstructions between the player and camera origin. It auto-moves the camera. In this game, I got stuck behind a pillar or tree or bush until I'm dead. Also, they did not notice to zoom out on the camera for mega-boss stages, so you're often looking between Wukong's legs or the earth.4) Inconsistent stage design. In act 1, the game has shrines right before main bosses. Later on, you must run back across entire stages to get back to a boss. If you die many times... Good luck.5) Toxic community. Astroturfing by China fanboys makes it impossible to get help or raise attention to the devs for fixes. No dissent is allowed. Everything else is downvoted or harrassed. You can't even make recommendations on tuning graphic settings. Even asking to tune down the difficulty traps you into needless arguments about how to get good. It's amazing how rude they are to older adults with jobs and kids, but still want to enjoy the story.Devs have not communicated on improving the game. Best to wait for actual substantial updates before making a purchase.-----------------28 Aug 2024Made it into act 4. Act 3 is easily 3 times larger than act 1 and 2, which is extremely tedious. Invisible walls everywhere. Many corners look like they can be explored, but are dead ends with no visual design to prevent us from wasting time. You can't interact with the environment unlike Genshin Impact. There's no flying. No wall climbing. Even warframe, a FREE game, I can bullet jump and wall latch. The movement here makes the monkey king look lame.Boss fights in act 3 were also lame. You dance between the boss legs, so your camera is always twitching between his legs and floor. The company calls itself Game Science, claiming to be a serious science and engineering studio... But learned no lessons by GOTY games over the past decade for such things.After unlocking most skills, the game play is also... boring. A few enemies have long attack chains, yet you must keep dodging because upgraded attacks cannot disrupt them. Thus, Dodge Fest Simulator.So you'll cheese it by charging up thrust stance right? That's even more boring. You can't spam magic as magic does NOT recharge until you get special gourd much later. So you have to save your spells and transformation by cheesing through the entire stageORbe forced tododgedodgedodgedodgebecause enemies cannot be interrupted without charged heavy attacks. So keep dodging until your focal points are enough to heavy attack. Then repeat dodging.Finally, the story?It's as if the devs have never studied their own culture or history. The reasons that I love Journey to the West, even studied asian religions and philosophies in university, was because of the deeply respectful and profound allegorical discourses absent from other civilisations. From a story writing perspective, this is important. 3000+ years of profound and rich source material exists for story writers.There's an abundance to create a beautiful cast of characters, each with deep complex portrayals that could have made the story profoundly moving. But none of that was seen.""Journey to the West"" was written at a time (circa 1592) when Buddhism had thrived in a huge sprawling dynastic empire (circa Tang Dynasty 618-907). Before Buddhism came (circa BCE 206), Shamanism, rich regional folk lore, Taoism (circa BCE 450), Confucius (circa BCE 551, Hundred Schools of Thought era),  and all manner of secular sects were already deeply rooted. ""Journey to the West"" is a rare culmination of allegorical novel writing popular over centuries. Yet, none of this was used in game.Instead, the characters are shallow and lacking depth. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are liars neglecting vows. Celestial court is full of superficial violent immortals. Humans are weak animals at their mercy. Demons are always evil because it is their birth nature. The profound essence of China's culture no longer exists in the game. Like China cities today, all that exists in the game is a beautiful facade. What is China culture?In the original novel, countless profound moments exist. The one I love is about the length of their journey in chapter 24:""你自小时走到老，老了再小，老小千番也还难。只要你见性志诚，念念回首处，即是灵山。""""You can walk from young till old, from old till young again, and even for 1000 cycles, it would still be difficult (to reach the end of your journey). But once you truly achieve the resolute perception (of wisdom), (realising that) Buddha-nature (exists) in all things, then you will have immediately arrived at Spirit Mountain (at the end of your journey).""There are countless lines of beautiful prose and poetry peppered across the original novel.Moments when loyalty and brotherhood stand in contrast to easy victories and unscrupulous tactics. Moments when you realise, for all of Wukong's fiery temper and violence, he is a person that deeply cares about doing the right thing with a deep penetrating wisdom that cuts through the commonly accepted social beliefs. Disappointingly, all of that. Gone. Lost.All we have left is a beautiful spectacle mired by aggressive toxic fanboys and a superficial court (studio)?Maybe this is the ultimate allegory; spiritual successor in the lamentation of modern China. 表面美化，盖掉缺点，心中百烂。Maybe that is the true intent of the game developers.",False,

Napoleonic S,88.9,"September 26, 2024",26,"The game has enough recommendations already so I choose to put this review on the not recommended section, click bait aside I do think that the game is over rated.I'm not a souls genre player, and I rarely play action oriented games, but I'm used to play other kind of games that requires a lot of trials and errors or practice to enjoy, therefore I wasn't shocked by the perceived difficulty of the game.The game is only slightly open world with a few side quests scattered around the map, it feels mostly linear with the exception of the last chapter where suddenly the game went even more open with less linearity on how to approach the map.I think it's useless to describe the gameplay and the positives of this game, there arethousands of other reviews you can read and watch, but to me the biggest downside of the game is on the narration side.The narration is disjointed, requires you to have some level of familiarity with the original source material and requires you to have some level of understanding about Chinese socio-cultural contexts as well as Buddhism and Daoism to fully appreciate the story.Another bad thing for me is that most of the game world building lore is locked inside the game pause menu that will only get unlocked after you met or bested enemies, I think this is a staple of souls genre and as an RPG player I think it's a massive fail as it's the opposite from RPG that tries to immerse you in the world of the game, in here it became distraction and is totally unimmerisve.You can get that from YouTube that covers them, but as a stand alone game and story that is a massive fail on part of the developers.Aside from that performance wise the game continues the tradition of UE5 games that at times can offer amazing visuals but other times are not, riddled with stutters and unreasonable performance. And to make it worse somehow the game has no native HDR support, I could enable the UE5 HDR with .ini editing but it result in UI ghosting issue.Ultrawide 21:9 is natively supported with a few minor issues.Overall it's a solid first AAA Chinese game but they need to improve their story telling for their next game.",False,

But the best is this games business card - invisible walls. I am  now fighting a boss which just run thru invisible arena wall and shoots at you his crap from there. Just annoyance of bugs and glitches is too much alone not to give high rating for this game. You remember archers in Sekiro? OH YEAH they have them too here,some on unreachable platforms above the ground. And platforming in this game is just awful.Another UBER annoying thing is no map or other progress tracker. You just go to random places killing random bosses and chapter is finished. Then I googled some sidequest dude for which I could not find some items and VUALIA!!! it seems I missed like 40% map piece just because last chapter boss was in the middle and I had no clue because you must be drawing map yourself I guess. AND btw that side quest gives an item which makes boss battle easier. Can the progression be made even dumber?And even this is well made game,but chineese mythology doesn't grow on me. At least I get the feeling that I don't understand what most NPCs are talking about nor I remember the names of some big enemies like luangxianhu which makes me 0 invested in a story.

andrewb2332,43.9,"September 24, 2024",20,"There's literally two rules when it comes to these games make it a challenge but make it fair, this started off as ok but quickly became more annoying than challenging. The bosses have cheap attacks, yellowbrow literally has three scenes in his fight and each cutscenes drops your health to 1/4 and there's literally nothing you can do. This is basically on par with lords of the fallen when ever you beat a boss it doesn't feel like an accomplishment the whole game feels more like chore than a fun challenge. All this game did was get me more excited for the lies of p dlc and I can get back to an actually fun challenging game.",False,
Lansorel,1.9,"August 21, 2024",20,"Returned. Thank god it took me less than two hours to realize this game is boring. Souls like.. but worse. Combat is repetitive and the maps are clumsy and dull. Not open world.. just following a jenky path. Honestly just get Elden ring.. and if you already have that, this wont scratch any itch for you,",False,

There are certain parts of the jungle where the GPU usage tanks to like 40-50% and that is where the drop happens (for all video settings). Sometimes the drop does not happen and sometimes it does, weird.",False,
